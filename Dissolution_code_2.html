/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

Since the\nChennai-based life insurance entity has net free assets of Rs 60-65 crore, Reliance Cap will pay a premium\nof Rs 35-40 crore.\n\nNet free assets essentially denote the book value of an insurance company, calculated after deducting losses\nfrom its share capital. AMP Sanmar has a capital base of Rs 217.5 crore.\n\nThe non-banking finance arm of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Enterprise (ADAE) had initially decided to acquire\nAMP Sanmar through Reliance Life Insurance Company. But it was not possible as Reliance Life Insurance\nwas not a legal entity since it did not have a licence from the Insurance Regulatory and Development\nAuthority (IRDA).\n\nIRDA Chairman CS Rao told Business Standard since Reliance Life Insurance was not a legal entity, it could\nnot acquire AMP Sanmar. &#34;It is important for Reliance to identify the acquirer as the next step will be the due\ndiligence exercise to be undertaken by the insurance regulator,&#34; he added. Declining to comment on the\nactual value of the deal, Graham Meyer, AMP Sanmar CEO, said it had not been a distress sale.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 1 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

All rights reserved.\nNEW DELHI | MUMBAI: Walmart Stores spent $334 million (Rs2,025 crore at current rates) to end its\nhigh-profile retail partnership with Bharti Enterprises, resulting in a net loss of $151 million (Rs915.6 crore)\naccruing to the US company’s consolidated income in 2013.\n\nWhile the world’s largest retailer paid $100 million (Rs606 crore) to acquire Bharti’s stake in its India\nwholesale joint venture and go solo, it also took a $234-million (Rs1,418 crore) hit that included debt and\nother investments in back-end partner Bharti Retail that it waived as part of the October 2013 separation,\naccording to its annual report issued last week.\n\nWalmart paid the $100 million to acquire Bharti Enterprises’ 50% stake in the erstwhile Bharti Walmart Pvt Ltd\nthat ran 20 Best Price-branded cash-andcarry stores. It was widely speculated that Walmart had\ncompensated Bharti well to call off their six-year-old alliance but this is the first time the amount of money the\nUS company paid to end its India equal JV has come to light. Bharti officials couldn’t be reached immediately\nfor comment. Walmart India said it had nothing to add to the information already disclosed.\n\nET reported previously that it cost Walmart around Rs1,000 crore to purchase Bharti’s stake in the joint\nventure. After going well for the first four years since its inception in 2007, the Bharti-Walmart alliance turned\nrocky in the last two as the US firm focused attention on an internal probe to check if the unit had in any way\nviolated US anti-bribery laws.\n\nBharti, Walmart Trying to Expand Independently\n\nScott Price, Walmart’s Asia head who has now been elevated to a global role, told ET in an interview earlier\nthis month that the two partners had an &#34;amicable&#34; end to their six-year alliance. The two-year probe carried\nout by independent investigators, including US law firm Greenberg Traurig and consulting firm KPMG,\nprompted Bharti-Walmart to stall all expansion, suspend or sack top officials and ultimately drove a wedge\nbetween the partners.\n\nWalmart was intent on making sure that it hadn’t committed any violations of the US Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act, which outlaws bribes to foreign government officials by US-listed entities to run or secure\nbusinesses.\n\nThis followed a corruption scandal in Mexico, where company officials allegedly paid tens of millions of dollars\nin bribes to local officials to expand faster in the biggest foreign market for Walmart. After the Mexico episode,\nWalmart started investigating global operations including India and China. Walmart faced other difficulties in\nIndia as well. The Bentonville-based retail giant was hounded by Indian politicians for what was construed as\nlobbying to get India to open multi-brand retail to global supermarket chains.\n\nIt also came under attack for its $100-million investment in Bharti Retail’s holding firm in 2010 at a time India\nbarred any sort of overseas investment in multi-brand retail. Politicians alleged that Walmart broke India’s\nforeign exchange laws through what they called illegal and indirect capital infinfusion into Bharti Retail, which\nran a nationwide network of Easyday stores. Subsequently, India would change its rules to allow foreign\ndirect investment in multi-brand retail but with strict conditions attached.\n\nBharti will acquire the compulsory convertible debentures (CCDs) worth $100 million that Walmart’s\nMauritius-based investment arm had infused into Cedar Support Services, which owned Bharti Retail, as part\nof the separation agreement. In addition to the termination of the wholesale joint venture, Walmart also\n\n\n\nPage 2 of 2 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\nsnapped its &#34;franchisee and supply agreement with Bharti Retail Ltd which operates Bharti’s retail business in\nIndia and transferred its (Walmart’s) investment in that business to Bharti&#34;, the annual report said, apparently\nwith reference to the $100-million CCD investment.\n\nBoth Walmart and Bharti are trying to expand their businesses independent of each other. Walmart this\nmonth said it’s bullish on the India cash-and-carry business and plans to add 50 Best Price stores in the next\nfive years. ET has reported that Walmart, which has formed a new company called Walmart India, has\ninjected an additional Rs1,328 crore into its operations in the country after its break-up with Bharti. A\nsubstantial chunk of this will go into developing the cash-and-carry stores and allied infrastructure, according\nto people aware of the plans.\n\nFor Reprint Rights: timescontent.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 2 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

All rights reserved\nHarsh market conditions for downstream companies in India -- including hefty losses from sales of petroleum\nproducts below cost and a potential glut in domestic refining capacity -- are being blamed for last month\&#39;s\ndecision by BP to pull out of a mooted refining and marketing joint venture with Hindustan Petroleum.\n\nBP had informed Hindustan that its board had found other projects more attractive at this time than the\nproposed Bhatinda refining venture, Hindustan Chief Executive MB Lal told a Mar. 24 press conference in\nNew Delhi.\n\nLal noted that India\&#39;s downstream conditions had worsened since BP signed a letter of intent last October\nwith Hindustan to invest in a $3 billion refinery in Bhatinda in northern India. The agreement also involved\nsetting up a joint venture to market products from the proposed 180,000 barrel per day inland refinery through\na chain of cobranded retail outlets across India. &#34;They had ambitious plans,&#34; Lal told IPF.\n\nBP explained that its decision to abandon the joint venture with Hindustan was made because the project\ndidn\&#39;t fit with its current plans. &#34;It\&#39;s a robust project, but it\&#39;s just not the right project for us at this moment in\ntime,&#34; a BP spokeswoman told IPF. &#34;It doesn\&#39;t fit in with what we\&#39;re doing at the moment, so we\&#39;ve decided\nthat we\&#39;re not going to take the letter of intent forward.&#34; India remains &#34;a place we would still look at,&#34; for both\nupstream and downstream, she added.\n\nShortly after the letter of intent was signed, BP Chief Executive John Browne cautioned that this was no\nguarantee of any future alliance. &#34;We have a letter of intent, which is an agreement to agree,&#34; Browne had\nsaid. &#34;We do not have a deal.&#34;\n\nLal told reporters that Hindustan would go ahead with the refinery, which will be designed to process 100%\nsour crudes. &#34;We have a refinery on the east coast and one on the west,&#34; Lal said. &#34;The Bhatinda refinery is\ninland and complements the other two refineries.&#34;\n\nIndia\&#39;s northern region is short of products, and Bhatinda would help plug that gap, Lal said. Hindustan also\nplans to expand the east coast Vizag refinery, which processes 166,000 b/d, by 150,000 b/d at a cost of $1.7\nbillion. &#34;By 2010 we want to process 100% sour crudes in all our refineries,&#34; said Lal. &#34;Our refineries will have\nan 84% distillate content and make products suiting Euro-3 and Euro-4 standards.&#34;\n\nLal said Hindustan\&#39;s coastal refineries could become largely export oriented, with Bhatinda catering to the\ndomestic market, if Indian product demand remains largely flat at 2.2 million b/d.\n\nBP\&#39;s decision marks a blow to India\&#39;s attempt to attract foreign investments in the energy sector. The country\nderegulated its petroleum sector in April 2002, but oil companies were not allowed to raise pump prices in line\nwith global price levels for the past year, leading to huge losses -- Hindustan incurred losses of around $350\nmillion for the nine months ending December 2005 from selling petroleum products below cost.\n\nIndia\&#39;s petroleum sector, once touted as a high-growth market, is in the doldrums. The country\&#39;s existing 2.6\nmillion b/d capacity, spread across 18 refineries, is already 15% higher than current product demand, which\nhas been negative in the current fiscal year to end-March.\n\nBut this has not stopped the country from witnessing a boom in domestic refining investment, aimed at\nturning India into a global refining hub targeting export markets in Europe and the US. Hindustan\&#39;s Bathinda\nplant is one of eight refining projects that are set to add some 1.58 million b/d of new refining capacity to the\nIndian market by 2010, at a cost of around $12 billion.\n\nThe export drive has been led by private refiners such as Reliance Industries, which is adding a further\n540,000 b/d of processing capacity to its giant 660,000 b/d Jamnagar plant between now and 2009 (IPF\n\n\n\nPage 2 of 2 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\nOct.,p16). But Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) and Indian Oil Corp. (IOC) look set to jump on the export\nbandwagon, with both following the Jamnagar model by developing integrated refining and petrochemical\ncomplexes at Mangalore and Paradip, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 1 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

All rights reserved.\nBANGALORE: Nusli Wadia-controlled Britannia Industries has agreed to buy out New Zealand\&#39;s Fonterra\nfrom an existing dairy joint venture, Britannia New Zealand Foods.\n\nBoth Britannia and Fonterra, one of the world\&#39;s biggest milk co-operatives, agreed to call off the 51:49 JV,\nwith the acquirer assuming the cumulative losses and the exiting foreign partner writing down the investments\nmade into venture.\n\nThe deal will bolster and unlock further synergies in Britannia\&#39;s go-to-market strategy. The company in recent\nmonths brought biscuits, cakes &amp; rusks and dairy products like cheese, butter, ghee and dairy whitener under\none distribution vertical, while the \&#39;daily fresh\&#39; products, such as bread and dahi fall into another.\n\nThe company\&#39;s distribution was fragmented till some time back, with all the business units approaching the\ntrade separately.\n\nThe mainstay biscuits, non-biscuit bakery (breads, cakes &amp; rusks) and dairy constitute three strategic\nbusiness units within the Rs 3,000 crore company.\n\n&#34;We have a single go-to-market strategy for Britannia as far as possible, which is helping us, especially with\nthe modern trade. The distribution has been streamlined into two verticals, with the fresh consumption\nproducts like bread and curd forming one and remaining products going to the market under a separate\nvertical,&#34; Britannia Industries MD Vinita Bali told ET.\n\nIn fact, Britannia has tweaked its brand strategy to accommodate the fresh consumption products under a\nnewly-scripted Britannia Daily Fresh umbrella. Ms Bali said the dairy JV was reporting a turnover of Rs 200\ncrore and an annualized growth of 15-18%.\n\nThe JV, which had turned profitable in recent years, has accumulated losses of around Rs 38 crore. &#34;We will\nbe taking over the P/L of the JV and so the losses,&#34; she added.\n\nFonterra, a significant supplier of milk ingredients to global food giants such as Danone and Nestle, wanted to\nexit the Indian market since it could not deliver much value addition, given the fragmented nature of India\&#39;s\ndairy industry.\n\nFonterra is known for managing large dairy farms. It is not a big player in the branded dairy sector even\nthough it has milk powder offering under Anchor brand in several south east Asian markets.\n\nBritannia will ramp up its presence in the dairy space through new product offerings post acquisition of the\nFonterra stake. &#34;We will be looking at differentiated SKUs where we can innovate on the basic dairy\ntechnology.\n\nTake our cheese offering, for instance, where we have a market share of nearly 50%. We came out with slim\ncheese (with 33% lower fat) as well as cheese cubes and spreads that are clearly differentiated,&#34; Ms Bali\nsaid.\n\nThe Britannia-Fonterra JV exited the liquid milk market in 2004 in wake of mounting losses and has no plans\nof re-looking at the segment. &#34;It is a high volume low margin play that does not fit into our business model in\ndairy,&#34; she explained, suggesting that Britannia\&#39;s dairy play will essentially revolve around milk derivatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 2 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

(532868.BY), India\&#39;s biggest realty company by sales, will exit a mutual\nfund joint venture in the country with Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) because of a proposed regulatory\nchange, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said Monday.\n\n&#34;The move is prompted by a proposed regulatory change, which makes it mandatory for a company to have\nfive years of experience before selling mutual funds,&#34; the person, who didn\&#39;t wish to be named, told Dow\nJones Newswires.\n\nThe move is also in line with the New Delhi-based company\&#39;s strategy to focus on real estate development,\nthe person added.\n\nDLF currently owns 39% in the joint venture--DLF Pramerica Asset Managers Pvt. Ltd.--while Prudential\nowns the remaining 61%.\n\n&#34;DLF will sell its 39% stake to Prudential,&#34; the person said, without disclosing details of the likely valuation of\nDLF\&#39;s stake in the venture.\n\nSpokespeople from Prudential weren\&#39;t immediately available for comment.\n\nThe person said also that the time frame for DLF\&#39;s exit from the joint venture is yet to be decided.\n\nIn November 2008, DLF and Prudential had received an approval from the markets regulator, the Securities &amp;\nExchange Board of India, to jointly sell mutual funds and said they will jointly invest $45 million in DLF\nPramerica.\n\nDLF Pramerica was planning to start selling mutual funds in 2009.\n\nEarlier Monday, The Economic Times newspaper reported that DLF plans to exit the venture to reduce its\ndebt of nearly INR120 billion.\n\nDLF has been exiting its non-core businesses as part of its strategy to focus more on property development.\nThe company\&#39;s founders recently sold its multiplex-chain, DT Cinemas, to Indian multiplex operator PVR Ltd.\nThe real estate developer also previously announced plans to sell its wind power business.\n\nStill, DLF has a separate life insurance venture with Prudential, DLF Pramerica Life Insurance Co. Ltd., in\nwhich the Indian realty firm owns a majority 74% stake, while the remaining stake is held by the U.S.-based\ninsurance company.\n\n&#34;The life insurance business is continuing and is doing very well for DLF,&#34; the person said.\n\nThe life insurance business began operations in September 2008 with an equity base of INR1.1 billion. In\nNovember 2008, DLF had said that the companies will jointly infuse INR10 billion of capital over next five to\nsix years in the life insurance venture.\n\n\n\nPage 2 of 2 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

Ltd.\nThe country\&#39;s largest realty firm DLF has bought out its foreign partner Hilton in its hospitality firm DLF Hotels\n(formerly known as DLF Hilton Hotels Ltd) for an undisclosed sum. DLF held majority stake in the 74:26 joint\nventure that clocked revenues of Rs 22.95 crore with profit after tax of Rs 14.5 crore during the year ended\nMarch 31, 2011. The financial details of the latest transaction stands undisclosed but it would run into several\ncrores, reports VCCircle.\n\nAlthough the JV did not manage to scale up as fast as hospitality industry analysts had hoped for, arguably\ndue to the economic slowdown that hit the hospitality business specially hard during 2008-10, the JV had paid\nup capital of Rs 534.5 crore as per balance sheet disclosure for FY2011.\n\nAmong the listed peers, a company like Hotel Leelaventure Ltd is currently trading 34 times its FY2011 net\nprofit. If this is taken as a benchmark, DLF Hotels could be valued at around Rs 510 crore or more and\nHilton\&#39;s stake could then be worth around Rs 130 crore ($25 million), as per VCCircle estimates.\n\nDLF, which also owns and operates the luxury segment hospitality brand Aman Resorts across the world,\nhad formed an alliance with Hilton for development and management of hotels in India a few years ago.\n\nThe debt-laden realty firm had been taking a hard look at the hotel business and among the many options, it\nhas been looking at the possibility of selling Aman Resorts.\n\nDLF had formed the JV with Hilton a few years ago, in one of the first large foreign direct investment\ntransactions in the hospitality sector in the country. Although various international hotel brands operate in\nIndia, with some of them having been here for decades, most of them entered the market through\nmanagement contracts by lending their brand names to local partners.\n\nImages, graphs or charts, if any, have been removed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 1 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co., Ltd.\nRealtor to focus on selling premium, luxury fashion brands in the country\n\nLess than a fortnight after ending its joint venture with Giorgio Armani, DLF said it is in the process of\nbreaking its partnership with another Italian luxury brand Salvatore Ferragamo as part of a move to exit luxury\nbrands business.&#34;Luxury is a futuristic business in India at the moment and does not have scale,&#34; DLF\nBrands Chief Executive Officer Dipak Agarwal says.\n\nThe real estate major will instead focus on selling premium and bridge-to-luxury fashion brands such as\nBoggi, Alcott, Mango, Mothercare, Claire\&#39;s and DKNY.&#34;This segment is much more profitable and scalable,&#34;\nAgarwal says.\n\nHe says that while luxury brands have a big future in India, it will require another five to seven years to\nachieve scale and market size.&#34;For us, size with speed was important,&#34; he says.\n\nThe company has had only four Ferragamo and three Armani stores since it entered the luxury brands\nsegment in 2008 as expansion of these brands in a limited market was getting difficult.\n\nIn comparison, UK retailer Mothercare, which sells prams, pushchairs, car seats, baby clothes and also\nmaternity clothes, entered India in 2009 and already has 42 stores in the country.\n\nIt will add 15 more stores this year.\n\nBoggi has 12 stores and DLF will add another three stores in the next one-year.\n\nThe luxury market in India is bogged down with issues such as high import duties and lack of skilled\nmanpower and quality real estate.\n\nThere is only one luxury mall in the country currently, the DLF Emporio in Delhi, and brands are reluctant to\nenter high street locations due to poor infrastructure around them.\n\nThe cost of retail real estate is very high and that has been nibbling into the profits of luxury retailers in the\ncountry.\n\nToday, it costs.8-10 crore to set up a luxury store while a store for a premium brand can be made for.70-80\nlakh.\n\nTo offset this cost, some luxury brands have resorted to reducing the size of their stores to improve the sales\nper sq ft of space.\n\nDLF Brands currently operates 120 stores for its brands and Agarwal hopes to take the number to 500 in the\nnext three to four years.\n\nWhile the company has decided not to invest in new luxury brands at the moment, Agarwal says it may help\nsome top brands enter the country through support on the real estate and supply chain fronts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 1 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

Educomp in its press release has stated that this move is part of their “consolidation\nstrategy&#34;, a third in a series of exits from non-core businesses. The company says that this stake sale has\nbeen made to avoid the need to fund losses and other capital needs of a non-core business. It is not clear if\nIndiaCan has been making losses that Educomp has not been able to fund.\n\nEducomp\&#39;s Consolidation: \n\nEducomp further plans to focus on digital content &amp; IP offering and asset backed offerings like schools and\ncolleges.  Note that Educomp Online is Educomp\&#39;s online education platform. It is not clear if there are other\nIP offerings or any in the pipeline. But it is clear that Educomp plans to keep its focus on digital. In January\n2013, Authorgen, a subsidiary of Educomp Solutions Ltd, had raised Rs 22 crore from Kaizen, a private\nequity firm and a German media company, Bertelsmann. Authorgen through its website, WizIQ.com enables\neducation service providers to create virtual classrooms and also convert document to flash. It appears that\nEducomp has also sold 50% stake in Eurokids International Ltd to a group of investors led by GPE India, last\nmonth. In 2011, Educomp merged Studyplaces.com after being acquired in 2010.  It is worth noting that\nKleiner Perkins, Caulfield &amp; Byers (KPCB), Sherpalo Ventures and InfoEdge, all investors in Studyplaces.com\nhad reported that they lost money in the business.  Educomp plans to further continue this consolidation\nprocess.\n\nOther Developments in the Education Sector\n\nNote that IndiaCan is the second acquistion for Pearson this year. In February 2013, Pearson had\nacquired the remaining 20% stake in TutorVista thereby increasing its stake in the company to 100%.\nTutorVista provides online tutoring service to students. In the same month, e-learning site\nMeritNationraised Rs 30 crore funding from Info Edge (India). With this investment, InfoEdge became a\nmajority stakeholder in Applect Learning Systems, the company that owns MeritNation. In March 2013, online\ntest platform, Rank Junction had raised undisclosed sum of money from Indian Angel Network. In the same\nmonth, Skoolshop.com, an ecommerce site run by Occasion Kommerce Pvt. Ltd had raised series A funding\nfrom Blume Ventures &amp; others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 1 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

Ltd.\nEmaar Properties PJSC, Dubai’s biggest developer, has decided to end its 11-year-old joint venture with\nMGF Developments Ltd in India following a year-long separation tussle between the partners.\n\nEmaar said in a statement on Wednesday it will take steps to reorganise Emaar MGF Land Ltd via a\ndemerger to sharpen its focus on its Indian operations and develop ongoing projects.\n\nThe development comes almost a year after reports first surfaced about a possible split due to disagreement\nbetween the partners but Emaar had denied any such move. The Dubai developer had brought in about Rs\n7,500 crore in the joint venture and owned roughly 49 per cent stake along with loans and guarantees while\nMGF held the remaining stake.\n\nWhile Emaar didn’t disclose details of the demerger, media reports have suggested that the Dubai firm is\nlikely to get a bigger share when the two partners split assets.\n\n“They were in discussion to thrash out the various issues with regard to debt and partly completed projects\nthat were stuck due to paucity of funds. It was a complicated process as it involves many running projects\nand large land parcels of about 7,500 acres spread over various cities in India,&#34; The Economic Times\nreported citing a person familiar with the development.\n\nEmaar MGF, formed in 2005, is known mainly for building the Commonwealth Games Village for athletes\ntaking part in the event’s 2010 edition in New Delhi. However, it faced massive criticism for delays and poor\nconstruction quality. It also tried to float an initial public offering but couldn’t do so after the stock markets\nplunged following the global economic crisis in 2008. It made more attempts to launch an IPO in 2009 and\n2010 but ultimately scrapped the plans.\n\nEmaar is famous for developing the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, in Dubai. Headed by chairman\nMohamed Ali Rashad Alabbar, Emaar has operations in 14 countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Asia\nand Europe.\n\nMGF Development was started by Shravan Gupta in 1996. It claims to have delivered 2 million square feet of\nretail space and is developing about 3 million square feet of retail space and 1 million square feet of\nresidential space.\n\nKnown for its retail assets at the time of forming the JV, MGF now has presence across residential,\ncommercial and retail segments with projects in Gurgaon, Mohali, Jaipur, Indore and Hyderabad. \n\nThe joint venture was formed during the heyday of real estate when huge capital flowed in. But exits have\nbeen a pain point with some markets under the grip of a slowdown. The past two years have been particularly\npainful for developers as tepid forced them to look for various financing options to survive. \n\nThe national capital region, where the company has maximum exposure, has been worst hit by the slowdown\nwith sales slipping significantly over the years. This has taken the unsold stock with developers to an\nalarming level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 1 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.\nMortgage major Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) on Tuesday announced it has bought\nthe 26% stake of Chubb Global Financial Services Corp. in their joint venture, HDFC Chubb General\nInsurance Co., for an undisclosed amount.\n\nThe general insurance joint venture was set up in 2001.\n\nAn executive at HDFC, who did not wish to be named, said the book value of the equity in the joint venture\nwas Rs100 crore; that would mean the book value of Chubb’s stake is Rs26 crore.\n\nConrad D’Souza, treasurer at HDFC, said the company has applied to the Insurance Regulatory and\nDevelopment Authority (Irda), the watchdog for the sector, seeking its approval for the change in the holding\npattern.\n\nPeople close to the development at HDFC, who did not wish to be identified, said Ergo, the insurance arm of\nthe world’s second-largest reinsurance company—Germany’s €37 billion (more than Rs2 lakh crore) Munich\nRe—is the front-runner to pick up the Chubb stake.\n\n“Till such time the Ergo deal is finalized, HDFC will hold 100% stake in the general insurance venture,” said\none of these people.\n\n“Initial joint venture strategies did not get translated,” said D’Souza.\n\nHDFC Chubb lags behind other general insurers such as ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co., Bajaj Allianz\nGeneral Insurance Co., and others in terms of premiums collected. HDFC Chubb collected premiums of\nRs200 crore for the year ended March 2006, compared with Bajaj Allianz’s Rs1,280 crore and ICICI\nLombard’s Rs1,590 crore.\n\nIn fact, according to figures provided by Irda, while companies such as ICICI Lombard and Reliance General\nInsurance are growing at 30-40%, HDFC Chubb was actually not growing at all.\n\nThe two companies differed on strategy, with HDFC favouring an aggressive customer acquisition strategy\nwith a range of products and Chubb preferring a more conservative approach; “Chubb’s focus and HDFC’s\nfocus were not the same,” said the executive at HDFC.\n\nShrirang Samant, the insurance firm’s chief executive officer, quit two weeks ago.\n\nIndian insurance law caps an overseas partner’s stake in an insurance venture at 26%, which restricts the\namount of equity a foreign partner can put into a business that is highly capital-intensive.\n\nHDFC, which also has a life insurance joint venture with the UK’s Standard Life, wants a strategic partner\nwith experience in general insurance, said the HDFC executive.\n\n“There are people interested in partnering with us,” said the executive.\n\nD’Souza said the proposed stake sale would be finalized only after the regulator’s approval. D’Souza also\nsaid insurance firms, both international and domestic, have expressed interest in picking up the Chubb stake.\n\n\n\nPage 2 of 2 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\n“As of now, we will run the business as it is. Who comes in as a partner or who will be the CEO will be\ndecided only after the regulator’s approval of the buyout,’’ D’Souza said.\n\nIndia has licensed 15 overseas and local non-life insurers as part of its plan to open the sector to expand\ncoverage of insurance in the world’s second fastest growing major economy. The foreign investment cap of\n26% has been an irritant for most foreign firms, which claim that this restricts their ability to invest in the\nbusiness.\n\nThe industry has been lobbying to raise the limit on foreign investment to 49%, but this has met with political\nopposition from some quarters. Several foreign insurance firms have informal arrangements with their Indian\npartners to increase their stake to 49%, should this be allowed.\n\nReuters andGautam Chakravorthy of Bloomberg contributed to this story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 2 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

Diligent Media Corporation Ltd.\nLocal partner will buy out Canadian major\&#39;s 26% stake in the JV\n\nIt\&#39;s almost official. HDFC and Chubb, financial giants in their own right who had joined hands for a general\ninsurance venture in the country, are parting ways.\n\nHDFC has agreed to buy out the 26% stake held by the foreign partner in the joint venture HDFC Chubb\nGeneral Insurance Company and has applied to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA)\nfor requisite approvals, an HDFC official told DNA Money on Tuesday.\n\nThe company will continue as HDFC Chubb till a name change comes about, for which it has to apply to the\nRegistrar of Companies.\n\nHDFC will now hold 100% in the venture, though it is open to a 26% foreign equity participation once it finds\nan appropriate foreign partner. The JV currently has an equity base of Rs 125 crore.\n\n&#34;All employees will continue to be a part of the same company, where HDFC will have the entire stake and\nwe will chose someone to head the company once all this is through,&#34; the official said.\n\nFissures in the over four-year relationship have grown since last year because of differing risk appetites of the\npartners.\n\nHDFC, given its size and distribution strength, was keen to move fast.\n\nHowever, Chubb had an overcautious approach, particularly on commercial insurance, which was proving to\nbe a drag on the company, the official said.\n\nWhile all general insurance companies have grown their business, HDFC Chubb General reported a decline\nin business by 7.59% for 2006-07. Its total business premium was Rs 205.77 crore, one of the lowest in the\ngeneral insurance industry. Its counterparts and even later entrants have marched way ahead, even as the\npublic sector companies with a large base have also grown at higher rates.\n\nAlso, the dynamics of the Rs 25,000 crore general insurance industry has changed since the detariff regime\nkicked off in January this year and there was a crying need for a cohesive management structure to fight it\nout in the fiercely competitive market place. A formal split was thus waiting to happen.\n\nOn the kind of signals the split sends out, the official said, &#34;In fact, investors should be happy as there was a\ngenuine concern for the company\&#39;s falling numbers and now there is a concerted effort to grow the company.\nEveryone has a different way of functioning, and given the fact that all our other companies, like life\ninsurance, asset management, bank and the BPO, are doing so well, there should not be any misconception\non the break-up, which has been mutually agreed upon,&#34; the official added.\n\nSo, what happens to Chubb now? Sources indicated that the global insurance giant is unlikely to discontinue\ninsurance business in India. More so, as insurance analysts say, it would be a costly proposition to leave\nIndia at this juncture, at a time when the economy is booming, and re-entering later may see it lose two to\nthree years straightaway.\n\nMarket grapevine has it that Chubb is also scouting around for partners. This time, though, it may find some\ncomfort with a clutch of investors instead of one single company, possibly including some high net-worth\n\n\n\nPage 2 of 2 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

This, however, could not be confirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 1 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

The decision will\ncome into effect from April 1, 2008.\n\nUnder the alliance, EIH managed and ran seven five-star hotels under the Trident Hilton brand Gurgaon,\nAgra, Cochin, Jaipur, Udaipur, Bhubaneshwar and Chennai. It also has a five-star deluxe property christened\nHilton Towers in Mumbai.\n\nEIH will develop the Trident brand independently. All seven hotels will now be called The Trident and the\ndeluxe property Trident Towers.\n\n&#34;We felt there was a possibility of a dilution in the Trident brand with Hilton\&#39;s overall development strategy in\nIndia. With Hilton planning to open the more downmarket Hilton Garden Inn in the country, we felt customers\nwould get confused between that and the Trident Hilton,&#34; said SS Mukherji, vice-chairman, EIH.\n\nRealty firm DLF Ltd had forged a 74:26 joint venture with Hilton International last year. It is this joint venture\ncompany that will be setting up the Hilton Garden Inn brand.\n\n&#34;The first Trident opened way back in 1988 and we entered into an alliance with Hilton only in 2004. So we\nhave always had our own marketing set-up which only has to be revamped. The company is already\nmarketing The Oberoi brand very successfully,&#34; said Mukherji.\n\nOver the next three years, EIH will add 1,300 rooms across three Trident Hotels in Mumbai, Bangalore and\nHyderabad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 1 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

Considering the heavy linkages on the international business and the\nnature of the customers and the market, the board has decided to divest the company\&#39;s entire shareholding in\nits subsidiary Quest lndia to the said Givaudan Group.&#34; The Indian transaction is expected to be completed\nbefore the end of the financial year, subject to the global deal happening within the same timeframe, it said.\n\nICI India has controlling interest in Quest India, which was established in 2001 as a joint venture between the\nICI Group and Hindustan Lever Ltd (HLL).\n\nAs per the joint venture agreement, ICI India acquired HLL\&#39;s 49 per cent shareholding in May this year and\nsubsequently acquired the remaining one per cent of the share capital held by a group company of ICI Plc.\nConsequently, Quest India became a wholly owned subsidiary of ICI India. Quest India reported net sales of\nRs 116 crore and a net profit of Rs 7.8 crore for the financial year ended March 31. The company is\nheadquartered in Mumbai and has its manufacturing sites in Daman with about 100 employees on its rolls.\nShares of ICI India were up seven per cent at Rs 372.10 on BSE on Wednesday. ICI has been carrying out a\nrestructuring exercise wherein it will exit from non-core areas and focus on growing the core ones both\norganically and inorganically. As a step in this direction, ICI India, in June this year, announced the sale of the\ncompany\&#39;s Uniqema business to UK-based Croda Group for around Rs 260 crore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 1 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

The transaction was concluded in February, which was when Gerdau had announced the\nstart of commercial production at the 300,000 metric tons/year specialty steelworks at Tadipatri in southern\nIndia’s Andhra Pradesh state.\n\nKalyani’s decision to exit the venture was owing to uncertainties in iron ore supplies in India, the official said.\n“We want to wait for a better situation before proceeding with expansions,” he said, adding that Kalyani’s own\nplant – a 670,000 mt/y integrated alloy steelworks at Ginigera in Karnataka – has been operating at only 50%\ncapacity for nearly a year on ore supply disruptions.\n\nIron ore for the Tadipatri works is being sourced from the ongoing electronic auction sales in Karnataka and\nfrom elsewhere, the official added.\n\nThe jv – Kalyani Gerdau Steels – was formed in 2007 through the acquisition of the assets of the 275,000\nmillion mt/y SJK Steel Plant in Tadipatri. Each partner held a 45% shareholding.\n\nLast month, Gerdau revealed it had begun commercial production at the mill now comprising a 350,000\nmillion mt/y blast furnace, a 6-megawatt power plant using gases from the furnace, a sintering plant, and a\nnew 300,000 mt/y rolling mill for special quality steel (SBQ) for the automobile industry.\n\n“As we begin our 112th year of business, the start of the production of special steel in India represents our\nexpansion to an important country, with an impressive cultural richness, good economic prospects and very\ndedicated people,” said André B.

The joint venture, which was set up in 1999 for making plastics machinery, has ended after\nDemag’s new parent, Sumitomo, decided to go it alone in the Indian market by floating a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary.\n\n“L&amp;T-Demag Plastics Machinery, the Chennai-based joint venture company, will no longer be in existence as\nL&amp;T has bought out its partner’s 50 per cent stake. Sumitomo, which acquired Demag in early-2008, has its\nown plan for India and it decided to break the relations with L&amp;T,” said a company executive.\n\nThe purchase gives L&amp;T complete ownership of the operations in Chennai. After announcing its exit from the\njoint venture, Sumitomo Demag Plastics Machinery said in a statement, “As already announced in March\n2008, Sumitomo Heavy Industries is proceeding to establish a subsidiary in India.” L&amp;T officials declined to\ncomment on the development.\n\nIn 2002, the joint venture company had built its first factory for injection moulding machines. Three years\nlater, it built a second factory in Chennai that doubled its production capacity to a thousand machines a year.\n\nSumitomo Heavy Industries inherited the 50 per cent stake in the operation when it bought Demag in March\n2008. However, for more that 10 years, Sumitomo has had a technical collaboration with another Indian\ninjection machinery maker, Windsor Machines in Mumbai.\n\nL&amp;T had started manufacturing injection moulding machines in 1990 in association with Demag Plastics\nGroup. But the two formed the 50:50 joint venture company only after nine years. Soon after, the venture had\nemerged as the leading injection moulding solutions provider in India.\n\nL&amp;T Demag launched a petition last year to the India government in which it accused Chinese rivals of\ndumping presses at below cost in the Indian market. The government responded earlier this year by imposing\nanti-dumping duties of up to 223 per cent on 10 Chinese companies. Among these, three are associated with\nChina’s largest injection machine maker, Ningbo Haitian Plastic Machinery Group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 1 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

Though the companies have\ndiscontinued that agreement, they will continue to collaborate on marketing TB drugs in South Africa as per a\nprevious agreement.\n\nAt the time of the signing of the February 2006 agreement, the companies believed that there would be\nstrength in the combination of Lupin\&#39;s TB and active pharmaceutical ingredient pipeline and Aspen\&#39;s\nmultidrug-resistant TB product line and experience with antiretroviral drugs.

All rights reserved.\nHYDERABAD: Hyderabad-based Hetero Drugs, makers of the Tamiflu capsules, has bought out the stake of\nGujarat-based Lyka Labs in the joint venture Lyka Hetero Healthcare for a consideration of Rs 6.1 crore.\n\nAfter gaining control of Lyka Hetero Healthcare, the company is busy drawing up a turnaround plan that\nincludes fresh investments for improving sales margins and addition of new molecules in cardiology and\nantibiotics.\n\nHetero expects the buyout of the JV partner\&#39;s stake in Lyka Hetero will give them the much-needed stability\nand foothold in the domestic market.\n\nWith its expanded basket, including formulations in antibiotics, pain management and anti- asthmatic, Hetero\nis expecting to reduce its dependency on APIs considerably. &#34;Most of our turnover comes from export of\nAPIs, where price volatility is high.\n\nBy attaining full ownership of Lyka Hetero Healthcare, we will be able to focus on marketing formulations in\ndomestic market. This will help us to circumvent the volatility, making our bottomline stronger,&#34; Hetero Drugs\ndirector (marketing), Srinivas Reddy, told ET.\n\nThe company is likely to undertake a management restructuring as part of the turnaround. For the erstwhile\njoint venture, Hetero Drugs is looking to achieve a turnover of Rs 70 crore in one year against the present Rs\n40 crore.\n\n&#34;We found it difficult to chalk out marketing strategies within the confinement of a JV. Now we can focus on\nachieving sales volumes for the existing products. It will take 12-18 months for the new molecules to attain\ncritical mass,&#34; Mr Reddy said.\n\nHowever, the company refused to make any comments on management restructuring. &#34;The valuation process\nis on. It will take at least one month for us to finalise investments and other changes,&#34; he said.\n\nLyka Hetero Healthcare was a 51:49 joint venture between Gujarat-based Lyka Labs and Hetero.

The Information Company Pvt. Ltd.\nMahindra &amp; Mahindra (M&amp;M) today said that its subsidiary Mahindra Defence Systems will acquire BAE\nSystems\&#39; 26-per cent stake in their defence joint venture, Defence Land Systems India (DLSI), ending a\nthree-year partnership with Britain\&#39;s biggest aerospace company.\n\nThe move comes just a year after the London-based company appointed Dean McCumiskey as managing\ndirector and chief executive of its Indian operations in place of Andrew Gallagher in order to lead the next\nphase of BAE Systems\&#39; business development in the country. (See: Dean McCumiskey to head BAE\nSystems in India (http://www.domain-b.com/people/in_the_news/20120123_bae_systems.html))\n\n&#34;This decision is a reflection of the shareholders\&#39; belief that they can best meet emerging customer\nrequirements and address the opportunities in this dynamic market with a flexible, tailored approach that was\nnot easily facilitated by the structure of the existing joint-venture entity,&#34; both companies said in a joint\nstatement.\n\nThe two companies had set up the JV in 2009 to develop new technologies and the manufacture of trusted\narmoured vehicles like the Axe, Rakshak, Marksman, up-armoured and bulletproof Scorpios and Boleros, and\nRapid Intervention Vehicles. (See: Mahindra, BAE Systems set up defence JV for land systems\n(http://www.domain-b.com/companies/companies_m/Mahindra/20091130_mahindra_group_oneView.html))\n\nAt present, DLSI produces combat vehicles such as Rakshak, Rakshak Plus, Marksman and MPVi, armoured\nbus, riot intervention vehicle and Scorpio Uparmoured for VIP security.\n\nThe company\&#39;s Prithla plant has a capacity to produce up to 800 vehicles a year, of which up to 120 are\nMPV-Is. In the last three to four years the company has invested about Rs60 crore on the plant.\n\nCommenting on the development, Brigadier (Retd) Khutub Hai, chairman and MD of Mahindra Defence\nSystems, &#34;This is a strategic decision and will enable both the companies to approach opportunities\nindividually and to offer customised solutions to meet the needs of the Indian defence land systems domain.&#34;\n\nDean McCumiskey said, &#34;Building domestic capabilities in partnership with Indian companies will remain a\ncornerstone of our strategy in India. We look forward to opportunities to collaborate with Mahindra and others\nto enhance the role of the private sector in the defence industry.&#34;\n\nM&amp;M also has a JV with US-based Telephonics Corp to make radar systems and another with UAE-based\nArabia Holdings and Ras Al Khaimah Transport Investments to develop armored vehicles for the Middle East,\nCentral Asia and African market.\n\nBAE also has a software engineering joint venture in India called BAeHA with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited\n(HAL).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 2 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

Following the purchase, both MNAL and MNEPL would become wholly-owned subsidiaries\nof Mahindra. Mahindra would take complete ownership of operations and continue to sell MNEPL and MNAL\nproducts albeit under its own brand name. The sale requires regulatory approval in India, is subject to the\nconclusion of definitive agreements, and is expected to be completed in early 2013. The terms of the\nproposed transaction call for Mahindra to pay approximately Rs.175 crores or USD 33 million, for Navistar\ngroup\&#39;s stake in both ventures. The payout will happen in two parts.\n\nWhile, 66 percent will be paid out as and when the deal goes through (upon the receipt of regulatory\napprovals), the remainder will be payable five years from the date of the first payment.\n\nThe agreement allows Navistar to continue sourcing components from India while Mahindra would continue\nto provide engineering services to Navistar. Navistar Group would continue to support M&amp;M through a license\nagreement and extend necessary support to MNAL and MNEPL for the purposes of business continuity.\nCrucially, the agreement covers the localised Maxxforce 7.2 litre engine. \&#39;Under the terms of our agreement,\nwe can use the Maxxforce engine for as long as needed for business continuity. The engine may be deployed\nfor the domestic market as well as export operations,\&#39; explains Dr. Goenka, President Automotive and Farm\nEquipment Sector. But, the engine is not exclusive to M&amp;M.; Navistar can still commercially exploit it, subject\nto, \&#39;a non-compete clause\&#39;.\n\nFurther investments\n\nSo far, MNAL has registered sales of just 6,000 units in the last 2-3 years, significantly below expectation.\nThis is because, any new player entering the Indian truck market has to contend with the strong incumbents.\nAnd the going has not been easy this year, thanks to the slowdown-induced spell of heavy discounting.\nTherefore, the JV has seen accumulated losses to the tune of Rs 692 crore, as against investments of Rs\n1,066 crore. But this scenario has not dampened M&amp;M\&#39;s commitment to the CV industry. \&#39;We stay committed\nto the truck and bus industry. Our dealers and trade partners are extremely happy with our intent to acquire\nNavistar\&#39;s stake. As a matter of fact, we shall be investing more into the truck and bus business,\&#39; asserts Dr.\nGoenka. M&amp;M reportedly intends to plough Rs 200-300 crore in a bid to turnaround MNAL\&#39;s operations over\nthe next three years. The investment is meant to support and expand the range of almost completely\nlocalised trucks and engines as also its robust dealer and service network.\n\nM&amp;M is confident that it can succeed in the truck business on its own steam. \&#39;Given that we have a product\nrange that is well-suited to the Indian market\&#39;s needs, we do not feel the immediate need for a foreign JV\npartner. But, to be honest, we have not yet applied serious thought to this aspect,\&#39; reveals Dr. Goenka.\n\nNavistar has decided to exit the JV because its finances are not in good shape. It has been the subject of\ninvestor activism and also the target of a speculated takeover by VW. What is more, a failed EPA 10\nemissions compliance strategy saw longstanding Chairman Dan Ustian quit his position.\n\nNot surprisingly, the new management led by President and Chief Operating Officer, Troy Clarke is focussing\non only those business areas that promise immediate return on capital under the \&#39;Drive to Deliver\&#39;\nprogramme. \&#39;While the Indian market has not expanded as we had originally expected and industry\nchallenges there continue in the near term, we still see promise in India going forward. But given Navistar\&#39;s\n2013 priorities, our capital and focus needs to be allocated to other business opportunities in the near term.\&#39;\n\n\n\nPage 2 of 2 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\nThe end to the MNAL JV follows the recent dissolution of the MANFORCE JV. Industry observers believes\nthat given the tough and competitive nature of India\&#39;s auto industry, it is often difficult to align the visions of\nIndian and foreign partners. Indeed, buyout of a partner\&#39;s stake is not an alien concept for M&amp;M.; It has\nacquired Renault\&#39;s stake in the erstwhile JV covering the localisation and sales of cars and utility vehicles\nunder the Logan brand. In a possibly encouraging precedent for the truck business, the Logan, now badged\nVerito has been performing better than it did under Mahindra- Renault.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 1 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

We have neither lost or gained in financial terms,&#34; Mr Sarkar said.\n\nHe added that the Michelin group would continue to hold the 14.9 per cent stake it acquired in Apollo Tyres\ntwo years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 1 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

As part of the strategy, New York Life has divested its stake\nin operations in Thailand, Hong Kong, South Korea and China since last year.\n\nThe US insurer has agreed to pay around one-third of the sale proceeds to its local partner for its contribution\nin building the business and creating its valuation as well as for giving consent for the deal, even though Max\nIndia is not selling any shares itself.\n\nNew York Life\&#39;s stake in the Indian insurance JV is estimated to be worth around Rs 3,500 crore and Max\nIndia could end up earning Rs 1,000-1,100 crore on the basis of this valuation.\n\n&#34;Our JV is a highly successful operation that provides important insurance products to the people of India. We\ndo not comment on rumours,&#34; said a New York Life spokesman. Max India did not respond to an emailed\nquery. Max New York Life, the country\&#39;s largest non-banking private insurer, was incorporated in 2000 and is\none of the earliest joint venture companies involving a foreign partner.\n\nIn addition to New York Life, Max India has a 70% stake in the company and Axis Bank holds the remaining\n4%.

All rights reserved.\nNippon Chemiphar and Ranbaxy Laboratories terminated their comprehensive business alliance, including\ncapital ties, on December 8. How the two companies will move in the market for generics in Japan has been\nwatched with great interest since Daiichi Sankyo acquired Ranbaxy in 2008. They have finally decided to\nterminate their relationship initiated in 2002 and independently follow their own path.\n\nFifty percent of the shares of Nihon Pharmaceutical Industry (NPI) owned by Ranbaxy were acquired by\nNippon Chemiphar for Y1.6 billion on the same day. NPI will continue to market four generics introduced from\nRanbaxy and sell them through Nippon Chemiphar in Japan. Annual sales of these four products are\napproximately Y1 billion. The effect of the deal on its business will be “minimal,”according to Nippon\nChemiphar.\n\nRanbaxy acquired 10% of shares of NPI, a subsidiary of Nippon Chemiphar, in 2002, and increased its\nownership to 50% in 2005. However, its acquisition by Daiichi Sankyo has basically changed its strategy, and\nit has been obliged to reconsider its relationship with Nippon Chemiphar.\n\nAccording to Nippon Chemiphar, the two companies have been discussing the new partnership since\nsummer in 2008. At the beginning, they discussed how to continue, not to terminate, their partnership. As\nthey reviewed their mutual strategy, however, they have reached a conclusion that the best for both\ncompanies is to independently develop their own business. “This is a friendly, forward-looking\ndecision,”according to Nippon Chemiphar.\n\n“I don\&#39;t think Nippon Chemiphar will be able to fully develop its generics business on its own. We will consider\npartnering,”said President Kazushiro Yamaguchi of Nippon Chemiphar at a press conference in July 2008\ncommenting on the possibility of M&amp;As and alliances for the development of his company\&#39;s generics\nbusiness. At present, however, the company is not negotiating alliances with any foreign-affiliated generic\ncompany, according to the company\&#39;s Public Relations Department.\n\nDaiichi Sankyo has not clarified its generics business policy in Japan. “We are analyzing recent market trends\nand weighing all possible options,”said a spokesperson for the company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 1 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.\nAshok Leyland has completed the acquisition of three joint ventures (JVs) with Nissan, the company said in a\nstatement. The three JVs in question are Ashok Leyland Nissan Vehicles Ltd (ALNVL) for vehicle\nmanufacturing; Nissan Ashok Leyland Power Train Ltd (NALPT) for making powertrains; and Nissan Ashok\nLeyland Technologies Ltd (NALT), a technology JV. All the three JVs operate in the light commercial vehicle\n(LCV) space. As part of the agreement reached between Ashok Leyland and Nissan, the latter transferred its\nshareholding in the three ventures to the former for a consolidated consideration of INR3 (USD0.04). Ashok\nLeyland will continue to build the Dost, Partner, and Mitr LCVs, while servicing and parts availability for\ncustomers will be taken care of by a Nissan technical support team.\n\nSignificance: The completion of the transaction is on expected lines as the competition watchdog in India had\nalready cleared the deal agreed between the partners (see India: 7 November 2016: ). The two companies\nsigned the JVs in 2008 in an effort to gain a foothold in India\&#39;s light and medium commercial vehicle market.\nHowever, the partnership did not go as planned with delays in product launches, declining sales, widening\nlosses, and write-offs. Except for the Dost, the venture did not have any commercial success and the slower\nintroduction of additional variants further contributed to the losses. Early this year, the differences between\nthe partners came out into the public domain and subsequent development resulted in an exchange of legal\nnotices to each other before both the parties decided to call off the partnership in September (see Japan –\nIndia: 8 September 2016: ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 1 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

The remaining 30 per cent is with ad-for-equity media investor Bennett, Coleman and Company Ltd\n(BCCL), the firm behind media publications and TV channels like The Times of India and Times Now.\n\n“After a strategic review, Religare has expressed a desire to exit the joint venture. Religare and Aegon have\nagreed that Religare will exit once a replacement shareholder is identified and is approved by the regulatory\nauthorities,” Religare said.\n\nThe FDI ceiling for insurance sector is in the process of being hiked to 49 per cent which would allow Aegon\nto buy a part of the stake held by Religare. However, Religare would need to find other buyers for its\nremaining holding.\n\nAegon is an international provider of life insurance, pension and asset management.

The Press Trust of India Limited.\nNew Delhi, Nov 19 (PTI) After life insurance, financial services group Religare Enterprises has decided to exit\nmutual fund business with sale of its controlling 51 per cent stake in Religare Invesco AMC to the foreign\npartner Invesco.\n\nWhile a number of foreign fund houses have exited the Indian mutual fund industry -- the latest being\nGoldman Sachs -- there have not been many cases where Indian entities have sold the asset management\nbusiness.\n\nEarlier this year, Religare had sold its stake in its life insurance join venture. In May 2015, Religare had\nannounced that it will exit Aegon Religare Life Insurance Company by selling its stake to existing partner\nBennett, Coleman and Company Ltd (BCCL) of the Netherlands.\n\nReligare did not disclose the exact reasons for the sale of mutual fund business but sources said that the\ncapital is being unlocked through mutual fund. The funds through stake sale will be used for health insurance\nand lending platform.\n\nThe shares of Religare reacted negatively to the announcement and settled down at 2.04 per cent on the\nBSE in a strong broader market today.\n\nWhile the Indian mutual fund industry has been growing steadily, Religare Invesco has not seen any major\nupsurge in its asset under management in the recent past.\n\nIts average assets under management (AUM) stood at Rs 21,593 crore for the quarter ended September,\nonly marginally higher than Rs 21,009 crore as on March 31 this year. In between, it had fallen to Rs 19,518\ncrore in the quarter ended June.\n\nWithout disclosing the deal size, Religare said in a statement that it has entered into a definitive agreement\nunder which Invesco would increase its stake to 100 per cent in the joint venture. The transaction is subject to\nregulatory approvals.\n\nReligare held 51 per cent in the JV while Invesco currently has 49 per cent ownership.\n\nInvesco\&#39;s Senior Managing Director and Head of Asia Pacific Andrew Lo said it would further deepen its\npresence in India by taking full ownership of this business.\n\nReligare Group CEO Shachindra Nath termed Invesco\&#39;s decision as &#34;an endorsement of the Indian macros&#34;\nand also of the overall quality of the management team.\n\nSaurabh Nanavati will continue as CEO, along with the existing senior management team of the fund house.\n\nInvesco had purchased 49 per cent stake in March 2013, wherein it was also given an option to further\nincrease its stake before March 2016.\n\nIn the recent past, a number of foreign fund houses have exited the Indian mutual fund market, but in most of\nthose cases, the businesses were acquired by Indian entities.

Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co., Ltd.\nMove seen to be in line with plan to integrate the pipe-making facility with itself\n\nTata Metaliks has ended its joint venture for manufacturing drinking water pipes with Japanese partners,\nKubota and Metal One.\n\nThe move is seen as a prelude to a larger plan towards integrating the pipe-making facility with TML.\n\nThe joint venture, Tata MetaliksKubota Pipes (TMKPL) was incorporated in July 2007 as a 51% subsidiary of\nTML, with the Japanese partners Kubota and Metal One holding 44% and 5% stake, respectively.&#34;To start\nwith, TML will acquire 100% stake by buying out its Japanese partners in TMKPL.\n\nAfter which, the pipemaking business will be brought under TML\&#39;s fold.\n\nWe continue to see a lot of prospect in the business,&#34; said Harsh Jha, managing director of Tata Metaliks,\nwho is due to retire on Friday.&#34;We have separate agreements through which Tata Metaliks will continue to get\ntechnical and international marketing support from Kubota,&#34; he added.\n\nWhile there is an obvious tax advantage in the proposed move, TML\&#39;s board is also weighing other options\nfor TMKPL that will attract tax benefits.\n\nThis includes making TMKPL a conversion agent of TML.\n\nA clearer picture may emerge shortly, with the board due to take a call on it in the next three to four\nweeks.&#34;The company signed an agreement with Kubota and Metal One on March 25,2013, terminating the\njoint venture agreement being executed from July 20,2007 in relation to Tata MetaliksKubota Pipes,\nsubsidiary of the company,&#34; Tata Metaliks said to the BSE.\n\nSEVERE COMPETITION\n\nTMKPL, in which the partners had invested around.185 crore, was affected by severe price competition in\nductile iron (DI) pipes and was upstaged by intense price cutting by regional players in the last four to five\nyears.\n\nHit by low net realisations in an industry facing overcapacity, especially in the eastern region, TMKPL\&#39;s\nmargins suffered.&#34;At one point, price of pig iron and DI pipes were at the same level.\n\nThere was no premium on value addition which is absurd.\n\nThe DI pipe market is essentially led by projects.\n\nThere is no concept of marketshare.\n\nThe situation worsened till it became economically unsustainable for a lot of companies that were operating at\nvery low capacity,&#34; said an industry analyst.\n\nMINING CRISIS\n\n\n\nPage 2 of 2 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

Ltd.\nThe last of the links between Fiat in India and Tata Motors as far as sales and distribution goes has come to\nan end. While Fiat went independent with its sales and dealership network from May 2012, the distribution\nand outbound logistics piece was still being handled by Tata Motors. Fiat\&#39;s dependence on Tata Motor\&#39;s\nnetwork will end in March.\n\nFrom April 1, Fiat Group Automobiles India, Fiat\&#39;s sales and distribution arm, will be switching over to a new\npartner. Fiat has brought in their distribution and logistic partner from Italy to handle their logistics and\ndistribution in India from their plant at Ranjangaon, near Pune. Mercurio Pallia Logistics will take over the\ndistribution logistics of Fiat cars.\n\nMercurio Pallia a joint venture company between Gruppo Mercurio of Italy and Pallia Transport of India.\nGruppo Mercurio is owned by Gefco Logistics. Fiat works with Gefco in Italy and some European markets.\nGefco is a subsidiary of Peugeot of France and is into vehicle transport and distribution business across the\nglobe with a turnover of 3.8 billion euro.\n\nRobert DeCrick, head, supply chain management (APAC), Fiat Chrysler, said, &#34;They chose to go with an\nexpert in the business rather than doing it themselves. This is not about fencing some agriculture land and\nstarting to park on it. Unlike the car yards in India, the new Fiat stockyard was built on a solid surface with\nsafety and security that ensure a better quality car was delivered to the customer. The yard also used IT\nextensively to offer better visibility for the dealership from invoice to delivery at the dealerships.&#34;\n\nOn whether this investment in logistics would put an additional burden on the comapny\&#39;s costs, DeCrick said\nthey did not view logistics as cost but as a key part of their business.\n\nThe new logistics partner will be able to handle customer demands better and with the use of technology\ndealers will he happier as they will be able to track their supplies from invoice to the delivery of cars at their\ndealerships, DeCrick said.\n\nAs of now Fiat has 25 dealerships and is adding six nee dealership in two weeks. The target is to reach 110\ndealerships by December 2013. Fiat earlier had a network of 170 dealers through Tata Motors. Though the\nsix year sales tie-up has ended, the manufacturing JV between Tata Motors and Fiat India remains intact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 1 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

The easing of norms comes following enhanced business ties\nbetween India and Japan.\n\nThe RBI’s fair value pricing norm does not allow companies to buy back shares at more price than the fair\nmarket value, and this is why the Tata- NTT DOCOMO deal could not be completed despite several notices\nfrom NTT DOCOMO and even the Japanese company initiating arbitration proceedings against Tata Sons\nand TTSL in London to recover its money. “Tata Sons has made the necessary application to the Reserve\nBank of India. The company is awaiting a response,” a Tata Sons spokesperson said while responding to\nqueries.\n\nIn March, 2009, NTT DOCOMO had invested $2.22 billion in TTSL to pick up 26.5 per cent stake. The\nshareholder’s agreement had guaranteed it at least 50 per cent of the investment if it wished to exit in case of\nTTSL failing to meet certain performance targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 2 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co., Ltd.\nTata Opportunity Fund to buy out the PE firm in the JV and form an infra entity that will, to start with, acquire\nthree road projects of IVRCL\n\nThree years after private equity firm Actis and the Tata Group formed a $200-million JV - with an ambitious\nplan to spend ten times of that sum in building roads over five years - the venture is coming to an end.\n\nActis is set to pull out of the JV and the Tatas have agreed to buy them out, said multiple sources aware of\nthe ongoing transaction.\n\nCurrently, Tata Realty &amp; Infrastructure (TRIL), a 100% subsidiary of Tata Sons, owns 65% of the venture\ncalled TRIL Roads while Actis owns the rest.\n\nTRIL was Tata Sons\&#39; initial vehicle for its foray into infrastructure and real estate development.\n\nThe Tata-Actis disengagement is likely to conclude within a month.&#34;Actis will make a marginal return on its\ninvestments.\n\nIts focus has moved away from roads into power generation and distribution and it will continue to focus on\nthese sectors through its infrastructure funds.\n\nThis will be an amenable exit,&#34; said an official.\n\nActis\&#39; exit is being facilitated by another Tata Group entity, Tata Opportunities Fund (TOF), the group\&#39;s\ncaptive PE fund which will buy them out.\n\nActis PE\&#39;s India head JM Trivedi could not be reached for comments.\n\nSpokespersons from Tata Groups\&#39; external media agency Rediffusion did not respond to ET\&#39;s detailed\nquestionnaire.\n\nLondon headquartered Actis - which was spun off from the Commonwealth Development Corporation nine\nyears ago - had invested $77.5 million (.345 crore) for its minority stake, in what was then its first investment\nin the Indian infrastructure space.\n\nThis money was deployed from its $750-million (.3,333 crore) emerging markets focussed infrastructure fund.\n\nClose to 30% of the fund\&#39;s proceeds were initially earmarked for India.\n\nDespite its initial ambitious plans, TRIL Roads and Actis has till date built only one project, the 110-km\nPune-Solapur highway with Italian company Atlantia SpA as its technical partner, for.1,371 crore.\n\nBut with TOF on board, TRIL Roads plans to pursue inorganic opportunities in the sector.\n\nTRIL-TOF TO BUY 3 IVRCL ROAD PROJECTS\n\nTo start with, it is already in negotiations to buy the three road projects of cash-strapped infrastructutre\ncompany IVRCL - Salem Tollways, Kumarapalayam Tollways and Changapally-Wallayar Tollways.\n\nThe three roads have been built on an estimated cost of.2,200 crore.\n\n\n\nPage 2 of 2 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

The acquisition of Qualcomm’s licence is crucial, as it will give Bharti an entry into four\nkey circles: the lucrative Delhi and Mumbai markets as well as Haryana and Kerala. Bharti, on its own, has\n4G spectrum in four circles, including Kolkata, where it has already launched services, Karnataka, Punjab\nand Maharashtra.\n\nUnder the agreement, Bharti will acquire the 13 per cent each held by Global Holding Corporation Private Ltd\n(part of the GTL group) and Tulip Telecom Ltd, to whom it is paying around Rs 140 crore each. The premium\nthe two investors will earn from the deal comes to an annualised return of around 28 per cent on their\ninvestment. The balance equity has been bought by way of subscription of fresh equity in the entity. The deal\nalso contemplates that once commercial operations are launched, subject to certain terms and conditions\nbeing met, Bharti would also pick up the remaining 51 per cent stake by May 2014.\n\nQualcomm had forked out Rs 4,912 crore to win the BWA licence and paid the money through a combination\nof debt and equity. That included about Rs 1,000 crore in equity and the rest through debt. The interest on the\ndebt for the last two years that the company forked out while waiting for spectrum comes to around Rs 1,000\ncrore. Based on this, the enterprise value of the company stands around Rs 6,000 crore. Barclays was\nmandated by Qualcomm to structure the deal.\n\nThe US company received its spectrum just a few weeks ago after a bitter battle with the DoT (Department of\nTelecommunications) and after it moved the TDSAT following a delay of nearly two years. The DoT gave it\nthe spectrum but with the licence period reduced from 20 years to 18.5. The roll-out obligation time was also\nreduced from five years to three and a half.\n\nCommenting on the deal, Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman and managing director, Bharti Airtel, said, “This\npartnership will combine the strength of Bharti’s national telecom footprint and Qualcomm’s technological\nleadership in the LTE TDD space. With a broadband-ready network across India, Bharti is well positioned to\nlead the next phase of Indian’s telecom revolution.” Apart from 4G, Bharti has 3G services in 13 circles. Bharti\nadded in its press release that with the deal, “it secured nationwide broadband leadership through a\ncombination of 4G and 3G, with its own networks in 18 circles”.\n\n“One of our key objectives has been to include a strong partner in the Indian venture with the scale,\nexperience and resources to deploy LTE TDD networks. We are pleased to have Bharti’s participation and\nsupport in this effort,” said Paul E Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Qualcomm.\n\nTulip Telecom chairman H S Bedi confirmed his company had been paid Rs 140 crore for the 13 per cent\nstake. “Yes, we have been paid Rs 140 crore, which is at a premium to what we had spent.” Asked how the\nRs 410 crore that Qualcomm has paid to the DoT on Tulip Telecom’s behalf for disputed dues, as directed by\nthe TDSAT, Bedi said, “We had an agreement with Qualcomm that only after we had exhausted all options\nand not found a remedy would we pay the money back. However, I am confident this is an erroneous demand\nby the DoT.”\n\n\n\nPage 2 of 2 © 2020 Factiva, Inc.

According to sources, the circles that have been\nidentified include Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, the north-east, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.\n\nDepending on the final policy and judgments on whether inter-circle roaming would be deemed legal, the\nmove could help Bharti become a pan-India 4G player, with presence in 15 circles.

Sharma,\nVarroc’s vice president for material and projects, in a telephone interview.\n\nDetails on the buyout were finalized in mid-August, he said. Terms were not disclosed.\n\nNow Varroc is expanding its polymer division by setting up three new facilities in different parts of India to\ncater to the various automobile hubs, according to Sharma.\n\nThe company is investing around $20 million in the plants.

Since the\nChennai-based life insurance entity has net free assets of Rs  -  crore, Reliance Cap will pay a premium\nof Rs  -  crore.\n\nNet free assets essentially denote the book value of an insurance company, calculated after deducting losses\nfrom its share capital. AMP Sanmar has a capital base of Rs  .  crore.\n\nThe non-banking finance arm of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Enterprise (ADAE) had initially decided to acquire\nAMP Sanmar through Reliance Life Insurance Company. But it was not possible as Reliance Life Insurance\nwas not a legal entity since it did not have a licence from the Insurance Regulatory and Development\nAuthority (IRDA).\n\nIRDA Chairman CS Rao told Business Standard since Reliance Life Insurance was not a legal entity, it could\nnot acquire AMP Sanmar. &#34;It is important for Reliance to identify the acquirer as the next step will be the due\ndiligence exercise to be undertaken by the insurance regulator,&#34; he added. Declining to comment on the\nactual value of the deal, Graham Meyer, AMP Sanmar CEO, said it had not been a distress sale.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

All rights reserved.\nNEW DELHI | MUMBAI: Walmart Stores spent $  million (Rs ,  crore at current rates) to end its\nhigh-profile retail partnership with Bharti Enterprises, resulting in a net loss of $  million (Rs .  crore)\naccruing to the US company’s consolidated income in  .\n\nWhile the world’s largest retailer paid $  million (Rs  crore) to acquire Bharti’s stake in its India\nwholesale joint venture and go solo, it also took a $ -million (Rs ,  crore) hit that included debt and\nother investments in back-end partner Bharti Retail that it waived as part of the October   separation,\naccording to its annual report issued last week.\n\nWalmart paid the $  million to acquire Bharti Enterprises’  % stake in the erstwhile Bharti Walmart Pvt Ltd\nthat ran   Best Price-branded cash-andcarry stores. It was widely speculated that Walmart had\ncompensated Bharti well to call off their six-year-old alliance but this is the first time the amount of money the\nUS company paid to end its India equal JV has come to light. Bharti officials couldn’t be reached immediately\nfor comment. Walmart India said it had nothing to add to the information already disclosed.\n\nET reported previously that it cost Walmart around Rs ,  crore to purchase Bharti’s stake in the joint\nventure. After going well for the first four years since its inception in  , the Bharti-Walmart alliance turned\nrocky in the last two as the US firm focused attention on an internal probe to check if the unit had in any way\nviolated US anti-bribery laws.\n\nBharti, Walmart Trying to Expand Independently\n\nScott Price, Walmart’s Asia head who has now been elevated to a global role, told ET in an interview earlier\nthis month that the two partners had an &#34;amicable&#34; end to their six-year alliance. The two-year probe carried\nout by independent investigators, including US law firm Greenberg Traurig and consulting firm KPMG,\nprompted Bharti-Walmart to stall all expansion, suspend or sack top officials and ultimately drove a wedge\nbetween the partners.\n\nWalmart was intent on making sure that it hadn’t committed any violations of the US Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act, which outlaws bribes to foreign government officials by US-listed entities to run or secure\nbusinesses.\n\nThis followed a corruption scandal in Mexico, where company officials allegedly paid tens of millions of dollars\nin bribes to local officials to expand faster in the biggest foreign market for Walmart. After the Mexico episode,\nWalmart started investigating global operations including India and China. Walmart faced other difficulties in\nIndia as well. The Bentonville-based retail giant was hounded by Indian politicians for what was construed as\nlobbying to get India to open multi-brand retail to global supermarket chains.\n\nIt also came under attack for its $ -million investment in Bharti Retail’s holding firm in   at a time India\nbarred any sort of overseas investment in multi-brand retail. Politicians alleged that Walmart broke India’s\nforeign exchange laws through what they called illegal and indirect capital infinfusion into Bharti Retail, which\nran a nationwide network of Easyday stores. Subsequently, India would change its rules to allow foreign\ndirect investment in multi-brand retail but with strict conditions attached.\n\nBharti will acquire the compulsory convertible debentures (CCDs) worth $  million that Walmart’s\nMauritius-based investment arm had infused into Cedar Support Services, which owned Bharti Retail, as part\nof the separation agreement. In addition to the termination of the wholesale joint venture, Walmart also\n\n\n\nPage   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\nsnapped its &#34;franchisee and supply agreement with Bharti Retail Ltd which operates Bharti’s retail business in\nIndia and transferred its (Walmart’s) investment in that business to Bharti&#34;, the annual report said, apparently\nwith reference to the $ -million CCD investment.\n\nBoth Walmart and Bharti are trying to expand their businesses independent of each other. Walmart this\nmonth said it’s bullish on the India cash-and-carry business and plans to add   Best Price stores in the next\nfive years. ET has reported that Walmart, which has formed a new company called Walmart India, has\ninjected an additional Rs ,  crore into its operations in the country after its break-up with Bharti. A\nsubstantial chunk of this will go into developing the cash-and-carry stores and allied infrastructure, according\nto people aware of the plans.\n\nFor Reprint Rights: timescontent.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

All rights reserved\nHarsh market conditions for downstream companies in India -- including hefty losses from sales of petroleum\nproducts below cost and a potential glut in domestic refining capacity -- are being blamed for last month\&#39;s\ndecision by BP to pull out of a mooted refining and marketing joint venture with Hindustan Petroleum.\n\nBP had informed Hindustan that its board had found other projects more attractive at this time than the\nproposed Bhatinda refining venture, Hindustan Chief Executive MB Lal told a Mar.   press conference in\nNew Delhi.\n\nLal noted that India\&#39;s downstream conditions had worsened since BP signed a letter of intent last October\nwith Hindustan to invest in a $  billion refinery in Bhatinda in northern India. The agreement also involved\nsetting up a joint venture to market products from the proposed  ,  barrel per day inland refinery through\na chain of cobranded retail outlets across India. &#34;They had ambitious plans,&#34; Lal told IPF.\n\nBP explained that its decision to abandon the joint venture with Hindustan was made because the project\ndidn\&#39;t fit with its current plans. &#34;It\&#39;s a robust project, but it\&#39;s just not the right project for us at this moment in\ntime,&#34; a BP spokeswoman told IPF. &#34;It doesn\&#39;t fit in with what we\&#39;re doing at the moment, so we\&#39;ve decided\nthat we\&#39;re not going to take the letter of intent forward.&#34; India remains &#34;a place we would still look at,&#34; for both\nupstream and downstream, she added.\n\nShortly after the letter of intent was signed, BP Chief Executive John Browne cautioned that this was no\nguarantee of any future alliance. &#34;We have a letter of intent, which is an agreement to agree,&#34; Browne had\nsaid. &#34;We do not have a deal.&#34;\n\nLal told reporters that Hindustan would go ahead with the refinery, which will be designed to process  %\nsour crudes. &#34;We have a refinery on the east coast and one on the west,&#34; Lal said. &#34;The Bhatinda refinery is\ninland and complements the other two refineries.&#34;\n\nIndia\&#39;s northern region is short of products, and Bhatinda would help plug that gap, Lal said. Hindustan also\nplans to expand the east coast Vizag refinery, which processes  ,  b/d, by  ,  b/d at a cost of $ . \nbillion. &#34;By   we want to process  % sour crudes in all our refineries,&#34; said Lal. &#34;Our refineries will have\nan  % distillate content and make products suiting Euro-  and Euro-  standards.&#34;\n\nLal said Hindustan\&#39;s coastal refineries could become largely export oriented, with Bhatinda catering to the\ndomestic market, if Indian product demand remains largely flat at  .  million b/d.\n\nBP\&#39;s decision marks a blow to India\&#39;s attempt to attract foreign investments in the energy sector. The country\nderegulated its petroleum sector in April  , but oil companies were not allowed to raise pump prices in line\nwith global price levels for the past year, leading to huge losses -- Hindustan incurred losses of around $ \nmillion for the nine months ending December   from selling petroleum products below cost.\n\nIndia\&#39;s petroleum sector, once touted as a high-growth market, is in the doldrums. The country\&#39;s existing  . \nmillion b/d capacity, spread across   refineries, is already  % higher than current product demand, which\nhas been negative in the current fiscal year to end-March.\n\nBut this has not stopped the country from witnessing a boom in domestic refining investment, aimed at\nturning India into a global refining hub targeting export markets in Europe and the US. Hindustan\&#39;s Bathinda\nplant is one of eight refining projects that are set to add some  .  million b/d of new refining capacity to the\nIndian market by  , at a cost of around $  billion.\n\nThe export drive has been led by private refiners such as Reliance Industries, which is adding a further\n ,  b/d of processing capacity to its giant  ,  b/d Jamnagar plant between now and   (IPF\n\n\n\nPage   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

All rights reserved.\nBANGALORE: Nusli Wadia-controlled Britannia Industries has agreed to buy out New Zealand\&#39;s Fonterra\nfrom an existing dairy joint venture, Britannia New Zealand Foods.\n\nBoth Britannia and Fonterra, one of the world\&#39;s biggest milk co-operatives, agreed to call off the  :  JV,\nwith the acquirer assuming the cumulative losses and the exiting foreign partner writing down the investments\nmade into venture.\n\nThe deal will bolster and unlock further synergies in Britannia\&#39;s go-to-market strategy. The company in recent\nmonths brought biscuits, cakes &amp; rusks and dairy products like cheese, butter, ghee and dairy whitener under\none distribution vertical, while the \&#39;daily fresh\&#39; products, such as bread and dahi fall into another.\n\nThe company\&#39;s distribution was fragmented till some time back, with all the business units approaching the\ntrade separately.\n\nThe mainstay biscuits, non-biscuit bakery (breads, cakes &amp; rusks) and dairy constitute three strategic\nbusiness units within the Rs  ,  crore company.\n\n&#34;We have a single go-to-market strategy for Britannia as far as possible, which is helping us, especially with\nthe modern trade. The distribution has been streamlined into two verticals, with the fresh consumption\nproducts like bread and curd forming one and remaining products going to the market under a separate\nvertical,&#34; Britannia Industries MD Vinita Bali told ET.\n\nIn fact, Britannia has tweaked its brand strategy to accommodate the fresh consumption products under a\nnewly-scripted Britannia Daily Fresh umbrella. Ms Bali said the dairy JV was reporting a turnover of Rs  \ncrore and an annualized growth of  - %.\n\nThe JV, which had turned profitable in recent years, has accumulated losses of around Rs   crore. &#34;We will\nbe taking over the P/L of the JV and so the losses,&#34; she added.\n\nFonterra, a significant supplier of milk ingredients to global food giants such as Danone and Nestle, wanted to\nexit the Indian market since it could not deliver much value addition, given the fragmented nature of India\&#39;s\ndairy industry.\n\nFonterra is known for managing large dairy farms. It is not a big player in the branded dairy sector even\nthough it has milk powder offering under Anchor brand in several south east Asian markets.\n\nBritannia will ramp up its presence in the dairy space through new product offerings post acquisition of the\nFonterra stake. &#34;We will be looking at differentiated SKUs where we can innovate on the basic dairy\ntechnology.\n\nTake our cheese offering, for instance, where we have a market share of nearly  %. We came out with slim\ncheese (with  % lower fat) as well as cheese cubes and spreads that are clearly differentiated,&#34; Ms Bali\nsaid.\n\nThe Britannia-Fonterra JV exited the liquid milk market in   in wake of mounting losses and has no plans\nof re-looking at the segment. &#34;It is a high volume low margin play that does not fit into our business model in\ndairy,&#34; she explained, suggesting that Britannia\&#39;s dairy play will essentially revolve around milk derivatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

Educomp in its press release has stated that this move is part of their “consolidation\nstrategy&#34;, a third in a series of exits from non-core businesses. The company says that this stake sale has\nbeen made to avoid the need to fund losses and other capital needs of a non-core business. It is not clear if\nIndiaCan has been making losses that Educomp has not been able to fund.\n\nEducomp\&#39;s Consolidation: \n\nEducomp further plans to focus on digital content &amp; IP offering and asset backed offerings like schools and\ncolleges.  Note that Educomp Online is Educomp\&#39;s online education platform. It is not clear if there are other\nIP offerings or any in the pipeline. But it is clear that Educomp plans to keep its focus on digital. In January\n , Authorgen, a subsidiary of Educomp Solutions Ltd, had raised Rs   crore from Kaizen, a private\nequity firm and a German media company, Bertelsmann. Authorgen through its website, WizIQ.com enables\neducation service providers to create virtual classrooms and also convert document to flash. It appears that\nEducomp has also sold  % stake in Eurokids International Ltd to a group of investors led by GPE India, last\nmonth. In  , Educomp merged Studyplaces.com after being acquired in  .  It is worth noting that\nKleiner Perkins, Caulfield &amp; Byers (KPCB), Sherpalo Ventures and InfoEdge, all investors in Studyplaces.com\nhad reported that they lost money in the business.  Educomp plans to further continue this consolidation\nprocess.\n\nOther Developments in the Education Sector\n\nNote that IndiaCan is the second acquistion for Pearson this year. In February  , Pearson had\nacquired the remaining  % stake in TutorVista thereby increasing its stake in the company to  %.\nTutorVista provides online tutoring service to students. In the same month, e-learning site\nMeritNationraised Rs   crore funding from Info Edge (India). With this investment, InfoEdge became a\nmajority stakeholder in Applect Learning Systems, the company that owns MeritNation. In March  , online\ntest platform, Rank Junction had raised undisclosed sum of money from Indian Angel Network. In the same\nmonth, Skoolshop.com, an ecommerce site run by Occasion Kommerce Pvt.

Ltd.\nEmaar Properties PJSC, Dubai’s biggest developer, has decided to end its  -year-old joint venture with\nMGF Developments Ltd in India following a year-long separation tussle between the partners.\n\nEmaar said in a statement on Wednesday it will take steps to reorganise Emaar MGF Land Ltd via a\ndemerger to sharpen its focus on its Indian operations and develop ongoing projects.\n\nThe development comes almost a year after reports first surfaced about a possible split due to disagreement\nbetween the partners but Emaar had denied any such move. The Dubai developer had brought in about Rs\n ,  crore in the joint venture and owned roughly   per cent stake along with loans and guarantees while\nMGF held the remaining stake.\n\nWhile Emaar didn’t disclose details of the demerger, media reports have suggested that the Dubai firm is\nlikely to get a bigger share when the two partners split assets.\n\n“They were in discussion to thrash out the various issues with regard to debt and partly completed projects\nthat were stuck due to paucity of funds. It was a complicated process as it involves many running projects\nand large land parcels of about  ,  acres spread over various cities in India,&#34; The Economic Times\nreported citing a person familiar with the development.\n\nEmaar MGF, formed in  , is known mainly for building the Commonwealth Games Village for athletes\ntaking part in the event’s   edition in New Delhi. However, it faced massive criticism for delays and poor\nconstruction quality. It also tried to float an initial public offering but couldn’t do so after the stock markets\nplunged following the global economic crisis in  . It made more attempts to launch an IPO in   and\n  but ultimately scrapped the plans.\n\nEmaar is famous for developing the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, in Dubai. Headed by chairman\nMohamed Ali Rashad Alabbar, Emaar has operations in   countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Asia\nand Europe.\n\nMGF Development was started by Shravan Gupta in  . It claims to have delivered   million square feet of\nretail space and is developing about   million square feet of retail space and   million square feet of\nresidential space.\n\nKnown for its retail assets at the time of forming the JV, MGF now has presence across residential,\ncommercial and retail segments with projects in Gurgaon, Mohali, Jaipur, Indore and Hyderabad. \n\nThe joint venture was formed during the heyday of real estate when huge capital flowed in. But exits have\nbeen a pain point with some markets under the grip of a slowdown. The past two years have been particularly\npainful for developers as tepid forced them to look for various financing options to survive. \n\nThe national capital region, where the company has maximum exposure, has been worst hit by the slowdown\nwith sales slipping significantly over the years. This has taken the unsold stock with developers to an\nalarming level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.\nMortgage major Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) on Tuesday announced it has bought\nthe  % stake of Chubb Global Financial Services Corp. in their joint venture, HDFC Chubb General\nInsurance Co., for an undisclosed amount.\n\nThe general insurance joint venture was set up in  .\n\nAn executive at HDFC, who did not wish to be named, said the book value of the equity in the joint venture\nwas Rs  crore; that would mean the book value of Chubb’s stake is Rs  crore.\n\nConrad D’Souza, treasurer at HDFC, said the company has applied to the Insurance Regulatory and\nDevelopment Authority (Irda), the watchdog for the sector, seeking its approval for the change in the holding\npattern.\n\nPeople close to the development at HDFC, who did not wish to be identified, said Ergo, the insurance arm of\nthe world’s second-largest reinsurance company—Germany’s €  billion (more than Rs  lakh crore) Munich\nRe—is the front-runner to pick up the Chubb stake.\n\n“Till such time the Ergo deal is finalized, HDFC will hold  % stake in the general insurance venture,” said\none of these people.\n\n“Initial joint venture strategies did not get translated,” said D’Souza.\n\nHDFC Chubb lags behind other general insurers such as ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co., Bajaj Allianz\nGeneral Insurance Co., and others in terms of premiums collected. HDFC Chubb collected premiums of\nRs  crore for the year ended March  , compared with Bajaj Allianz’s Rs ,  crore and ICICI\nLombard’s Rs ,  crore.\n\nIn fact, according to figures provided by Irda, while companies such as ICICI Lombard and Reliance General\nInsurance are growing at  - %, HDFC Chubb was actually not growing at all.\n\nThe two companies differed on strategy, with HDFC favouring an aggressive customer acquisition strategy\nwith a range of products and Chubb preferring a more conservative approach; “Chubb’s focus and HDFC’s\nfocus were not the same,” said the executive at HDFC.\n\nShrirang Samant, the insurance firm’s chief executive officer, quit two weeks ago.\n\nIndian insurance law caps an overseas partner’s stake in an insurance venture at  %, which restricts the\namount of equity a foreign partner can put into a business that is highly capital-intensive.\n\nHDFC, which also has a life insurance joint venture with the UK’s Standard Life, wants a strategic partner\nwith experience in general insurance, said the HDFC executive.\n\n“There are people interested in partnering with us,” said the executive.\n\nD’Souza said the proposed stake sale would be finalized only after the regulator’s approval. D’Souza also\nsaid insurance firms, both international and domestic, have expressed interest in picking up the Chubb stake.\n\n\n\nPage   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\n“As of now, we will run the business as it is. Who comes in as a partner or who will be the CEO will be\ndecided only after the regulator’s approval of the buyout,’’ D’Souza said.\n\nIndia has licensed   overseas and local non-life insurers as part of its plan to open the sector to expand\ncoverage of insurance in the world’s second fastest growing major economy. The foreign investment cap of\n % has been an irritant for most foreign firms, which claim that this restricts their ability to invest in the\nbusiness.\n\nThe industry has been lobbying to raise the limit on foreign investment to  %, but this has met with political\nopposition from some quarters. Several foreign insurance firms have informal arrangements with their Indian\npartners to increase their stake to  %, should this be allowed.\n\nReuters andGautam Chakravorthy of Bloomberg contributed to this story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

Diligent Media Corporation Ltd.\nLocal partner will buy out Canadian major\&#39;s  % stake in the JV\n\nIt\&#39;s almost official. HDFC and Chubb, financial giants in their own right who had joined hands for a general\ninsurance venture in the country, are parting ways.\n\nHDFC has agreed to buy out the  % stake held by the foreign partner in the joint venture HDFC Chubb\nGeneral Insurance Company and has applied to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA)\nfor requisite approvals, an HDFC official told DNA Money on Tuesday.\n\nThe company will continue as HDFC Chubb till a name change comes about, for which it has to apply to the\nRegistrar of Companies.\n\nHDFC will now hold  % in the venture, though it is open to a  % foreign equity participation once it finds\nan appropriate foreign partner. The JV currently has an equity base of Rs   crore.\n\n&#34;All employees will continue to be a part of the same company, where HDFC will have the entire stake and\nwe will chose someone to head the company once all this is through,&#34; the official said.\n\nFissures in the over four-year relationship have grown since last year because of differing risk appetites of the\npartners.\n\nHDFC, given its size and distribution strength, was keen to move fast.\n\nHowever, Chubb had an overcautious approach, particularly on commercial insurance, which was proving to\nbe a drag on the company, the official said.\n\nWhile all general insurance companies have grown their business, HDFC Chubb General reported a decline\nin business by  . % for  - . Its total business premium was Rs  .  crore, one of the lowest in the\ngeneral insurance industry. Its counterparts and even later entrants have marched way ahead, even as the\npublic sector companies with a large base have also grown at higher rates.\n\nAlso, the dynamics of the Rs  ,  crore general insurance industry has changed since the detariff regime\nkicked off in January this year and there was a crying need for a cohesive management structure to fight it\nout in the fiercely competitive market place. A formal split was thus waiting to happen.\n\nOn the kind of signals the split sends out, the official said, &#34;In fact, investors should be happy as there was a\ngenuine concern for the company\&#39;s falling numbers and now there is a concerted effort to grow the company.\nEveryone has a different way of functioning, and given the fact that all our other companies, like life\ninsurance, asset management, bank and the BPO, are doing so well, there should not be any misconception\non the break-up, which has been mutually agreed upon,&#34; the official added.\n\nSo, what happens to Chubb now? Sources indicated that the global insurance giant is unlikely to discontinue\ninsurance business in India. More so, as insurance analysts say, it would be a costly proposition to leave\nIndia at this juncture, at a time when the economy is booming, and re-entering later may see it lose two to\nthree years straightaway.\n\nMarket grapevine has it that Chubb is also scouting around for partners. This time, though, it may find some\ncomfort with a clutch of investors instead of one single company, possibly including some high net-worth\n\n\n\nPage   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

This, however, could not be confirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

The decision will\ncome into effect from April  ,  .\n\nUnder the alliance, EIH managed and ran seven five-star hotels under the Trident Hilton brand Gurgaon,\nAgra, Cochin, Jaipur, Udaipur, Bhubaneshwar and Chennai. It also has a five-star deluxe property christened\nHilton Towers in Mumbai.\n\nEIH will develop the Trident brand independently. All seven hotels will now be called The Trident and the\ndeluxe property Trident Towers.\n\n&#34;We felt there was a possibility of a dilution in the Trident brand with Hilton\&#39;s overall development strategy in\nIndia. With Hilton planning to open the more downmarket Hilton Garden Inn in the country, we felt customers\nwould get confused between that and the Trident Hilton,&#34; said SS Mukherji, vice-chairman, EIH.\n\nRealty firm DLF Ltd had forged a  :  joint venture with Hilton International last year. It is this joint venture\ncompany that will be setting up the Hilton Garden Inn brand.\n\n&#34;The first Trident opened way back in   and we entered into an alliance with Hilton only in  . So we\nhave always had our own marketing set-up which only has to be revamped. The company is already\nmarketing The Oberoi brand very successfully,&#34; said Mukherji.\n\nOver the next three years, EIH will add  ,  rooms across three Trident Hotels in Mumbai, Bangalore and\nHyderabad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

The joint venture, which was set up in   for making plastics machinery, has ended after\nDemag’s new parent, Sumitomo, decided to go it alone in the Indian market by floating a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary.\n\n“L&amp;T-Demag Plastics Machinery, the Chennai-based joint venture company, will no longer be in existence as\nL&amp;T has bought out its partner’s   per cent stake. Sumitomo, which acquired Demag in early- , has its\nown plan for India and it decided to break the relations with L&amp;T,” said a company executive.\n\nThe purchase gives L&amp;T complete ownership of the operations in Chennai. After announcing its exit from the\njoint venture, Sumitomo Demag Plastics Machinery said in a statement, “As already announced in March\n , Sumitomo Heavy Industries is proceeding to establish a subsidiary in India.” L&amp;T officials declined to\ncomment on the development.\n\nIn  , the joint venture company had built its first factory for injection moulding machines. Three years\nlater, it built a second factory in Chennai that doubled its production capacity to a thousand machines a year.\n\nSumitomo Heavy Industries inherited the   per cent stake in the operation when it bought Demag in March\n . However, for more that   years, Sumitomo has had a technical collaboration with another Indian\ninjection machinery maker, Windsor Machines in Mumbai.\n\nL&amp;T had started manufacturing injection moulding machines in   in association with Demag Plastics\nGroup. But the two formed the  :  joint venture company only after nine years. Soon after, the venture had\nemerged as the leading injection moulding solutions provider in India.\n\nL&amp;T Demag launched a petition last year to the India government in which it accused Chinese rivals of\ndumping presses at below cost in the Indian market. The government responded earlier this year by imposing\nanti-dumping duties of up to   per cent on   Chinese companies.

This will help us to circumvent the volatility, making our bottomline stronger,&#34; Hetero Drugs\ndirector (marketing), Srinivas Reddy, told ET.\n\nThe company is likely to undertake a management restructuring as part of the turnaround. For the erstwhile\njoint venture, Hetero Drugs is looking to achieve a turnover of Rs   crore in one year against the present Rs\n  crore.\n\n&#34;We found it difficult to chalk out marketing strategies within the confinement of a JV. Now we can focus on\nachieving sales volumes for the existing products. It will take  -  months for the new molecules to attain\ncritical mass,&#34; Mr Reddy said.\n\nHowever, the company refused to make any comments on management restructuring. &#34;The valuation process\nis on. It will take at least one month for us to finalise investments and other changes,&#34; he said.\n\nLyka Hetero Healthcare was a  :  joint venture between Gujarat-based Lyka Labs and Hetero.

The Information Company Pvt. Ltd.\nMahindra &amp; Mahindra (M&amp;M) today said that its subsidiary Mahindra Defence Systems will acquire BAE\nSystems\&#39;  -per cent stake in their defence joint venture, Defence Land Systems India (DLSI), ending a\nthree-year partnership with Britain\&#39;s biggest aerospace company.\n\nThe move comes just a year after the London-based company appointed Dean McCumiskey as managing\ndirector and chief executive of its Indian operations in place of Andrew Gallagher in order to lead the next\nphase of BAE Systems\&#39; business development in the country. (See: Dean McCumiskey to head BAE\nSystems in India (http://www.domain-b.com/people/in_the_news/ _bae_systems.html))\n\n&#34;This decision is a reflection of the shareholders\&#39; belief that they can best meet emerging customer\nrequirements and address the opportunities in this dynamic market with a flexible, tailored approach that was\nnot easily facilitated by the structure of the existing joint-venture entity,&#34; both companies said in a joint\nstatement.\n\nThe two companies had set up the JV in   to develop new technologies and the manufacture of trusted\narmoured vehicles like the Axe, Rakshak, Marksman, up-armoured and bulletproof Scorpios and Boleros, and\nRapid Intervention Vehicles. (See: Mahindra, BAE Systems set up defence JV for land systems\n(http://www.domain-b.com/companies/companies_m/Mahindra/ _mahindra_group_oneView.html))\n\nAt present, DLSI produces combat vehicles such as Rakshak, Rakshak Plus, Marksman and MPVi, armoured\nbus, riot intervention vehicle and Scorpio Uparmoured for VIP security.\n\nThe company\&#39;s Prithla plant has a capacity to produce up to   vehicles a year, of which up to   are\nMPV-Is. In the last three to four years the company has invested about Rs  crore on the plant.\n\nCommenting on the development, Brigadier (Retd) Khutub Hai, chairman and MD of Mahindra Defence\nSystems, &#34;This is a strategic decision and will enable both the companies to approach opportunities\nindividually and to offer customised solutions to meet the needs of the Indian defence land systems domain.&#34;\n\nDean McCumiskey said, &#34;Building domestic capabilities in partnership with Indian companies will remain a\ncornerstone of our strategy in India. We look forward to opportunities to collaborate with Mahindra and others\nto enhance the role of the private sector in the defence industry.&#34;\n\nM&amp;M also has a JV with US-based Telephonics Corp to make radar systems and another with UAE-based\nArabia Holdings and Ras Al Khaimah Transport Investments to develop armored vehicles for the Middle East,\nCentral Asia and African market.\n\nBAE also has a software engineering joint venture in India called BAeHA with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited\n(HAL).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

Following the purchase, both MNAL and MNEPL would become wholly-owned subsidiaries\nof Mahindra. Mahindra would take complete ownership of operations and continue to sell MNEPL and MNAL\nproducts albeit under its own brand name. The sale requires regulatory approval in India, is subject to the\nconclusion of definitive agreements, and is expected to be completed in early  . The terms of the\nproposed transaction call for Mahindra to pay approximately Rs.  crores or USD   million, for Navistar\ngroup\&#39;s stake in both ventures. The payout will happen in two parts.\n\nWhile,   percent will be paid out as and when the deal goes through (upon the receipt of regulatory\napprovals), the remainder will be payable five years from the date of the first payment.\n\nThe agreement allows Navistar to continue sourcing components from India while Mahindra would continue\nto provide engineering services to Navistar. Navistar Group would continue to support M&amp;M through a license\nagreement and extend necessary support to MNAL and MNEPL for the purposes of business continuity.\nCrucially, the agreement covers the localised Maxxforce  .  litre engine. \&#39;Under the terms of our agreement,\nwe can use the Maxxforce engine for as long as needed for business continuity. The engine may be deployed\nfor the domestic market as well as export operations,\&#39; explains Dr. Goenka, President Automotive and Farm\nEquipment Sector. But, the engine is not exclusive to M&amp;M.; Navistar can still commercially exploit it, subject\nto, \&#39;a non-compete clause\&#39;.\n\nFurther investments\n\nSo far, MNAL has registered sales of just  ,  units in the last  -  years, significantly below expectation.\nThis is because, any new player entering the Indian truck market has to contend with the strong incumbents.\nAnd the going has not been easy this year, thanks to the slowdown-induced spell of heavy discounting.\nTherefore, the JV has seen accumulated losses to the tune of Rs   crore, as against investments of Rs\n ,  crore. But this scenario has not dampened M&amp;M\&#39;s commitment to the CV industry. \&#39;We stay committed\nto the truck and bus industry. Our dealers and trade partners are extremely happy with our intent to acquire\nNavistar\&#39;s stake. As a matter of fact, we shall be investing more into the truck and bus business,\&#39; asserts Dr.\nGoenka. M&amp;M reportedly intends to plough Rs  -  crore in a bid to turnaround MNAL\&#39;s operations over\nthe next three years. The investment is meant to support and expand the range of almost completely\nlocalised trucks and engines as also its robust dealer and service network.\n\nM&amp;M is confident that it can succeed in the truck business on its own steam. \&#39;Given that we have a product\nrange that is well-suited to the Indian market\&#39;s needs, we do not feel the immediate need for a foreign JV\npartner. But, to be honest, we have not yet applied serious thought to this aspect,\&#39; reveals Dr. Goenka.\n\nNavistar has decided to exit the JV because its finances are not in good shape. It has been the subject of\ninvestor activism and also the target of a speculated takeover by VW. What is more, a failed EPA  \nemissions compliance strategy saw longstanding Chairman Dan Ustian quit his position.\n\nNot surprisingly, the new management led by President and Chief Operating Officer, Troy Clarke is focussing\non only those business areas that promise immediate return on capital under the \&#39;Drive to Deliver\&#39;\nprogramme. \&#39;While the Indian market has not expanded as we had originally expected and industry\nchallenges there continue in the near term, we still see promise in India going forward. But given Navistar\&#39;s\n  priorities, our capital and focus needs to be allocated to other business opportunities in the near term.\&#39;\n\n\n\nPage   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

Industry observers believes\nthat given the tough and competitive nature of India\&#39;s auto industry, it is often difficult to align the visions of\nIndian and foreign partners. Indeed, buyout of a partner\&#39;s stake is not an alien concept for M&amp;M.; It has\nacquired Renault\&#39;s stake in the erstwhile JV covering the localisation and sales of cars and utility vehicles\nunder the Logan brand. In a possibly encouraging precedent for the truck business, the Logan, now badged\nVerito has been performing better than it did under Mahindra- Renault.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

In May  , Religare had\nannounced that it will exit Aegon Religare Life Insurance Company by selling its stake to existing partner\nBennett, Coleman and Company Ltd (BCCL) of the Netherlands.\n\nReligare did not disclose the exact reasons for the sale of mutual fund business but sources said that the\ncapital is being unlocked through mutual fund.

While Fiat went independent with its sales and dealership network from May  , the distribution\nand outbound logistics piece was still being handled by Tata Motors. Fiat\&#39;s dependence on Tata Motor\&#39;s\nnetwork will end in March.\n\nFrom April  , Fiat Group Automobiles India, Fiat\&#39;s sales and distribution arm, will be switching over to a new\npartner. Fiat has brought in their distribution and logistic partner from Italy to handle their logistics and\ndistribution in India from their plant at Ranjangaon, near Pune. Mercurio Pallia Logistics will take over the\ndistribution logistics of Fiat cars.\n\nMercurio Pallia a joint venture company between Gruppo Mercurio of Italy and Pallia Transport of India.\nGruppo Mercurio is owned by Gefco Logistics.

This is not about fencing some agriculture land and\nstarting to park on it. Unlike the car yards in India, the new Fiat stockyard was built on a solid surface with\nsafety and security that ensure a better quality car was delivered to the customer. The yard also used IT\nextensively to offer better visibility for the dealership from invoice to delivery at the dealerships.&#34;\n\nOn whether this investment in logistics would put an additional burden on the comapny\&#39;s costs, DeCrick said\nthey did not view logistics as cost but as a key part of their business.\n\nThe new logistics partner will be able to handle customer demands better and with the use of technology\ndealers will he happier as they will be able to track their supplies from invoice to the delivery of cars at their\ndealerships, DeCrick said.\n\nAs of now Fiat has   dealerships and is adding six nee dealership in two weeks. The target is to reach  \ndealerships by December  . Fiat earlier had a network of   dealers through Tata Motors. Though the\nsix year sales tie-up has ended, the manufacturing JV between Tata Motors and Fiat India remains intact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

The easing of norms comes following enhanced business ties\nbetween India and Japan.\n\nThe RBI’s fair value pricing norm does not allow companies to buy back shares at more price than the fair\nmarket value, and this is why the Tata- NTT DOCOMO deal could not be completed despite several notices\nfrom NTT DOCOMO and even the Japanese company initiating arbitration proceedings against Tata Sons\nand TTSL in London to recover its money. “Tata Sons has made the necessary application to the Reserve\nBank of India. The company is awaiting a response,” a Tata Sons spokesperson said while responding to\nqueries.\n\nIn March,  , NTT DOCOMO had invested $ .  billion in TTSL to pick up  .  per cent stake. The\nshareholder’s agreement had guaranteed it at least   per cent of the investment if it wished to exit in case of\nTTSL failing to meet certain performance targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

The acquisition of Qualcomm’s licence is crucial, as it will give Bharti an entry into four\nkey circles: the lucrative Delhi and Mumbai markets as well as Haryana and Kerala.

FRENY PATEL &amp; KAUSIK DATTA Mumbai   words   August   Business Standard BSTN   English (c)   Business Standard Ltd. Reliance Capital will acquire AMP Sanmar Life Insurance Company for Rs   crore. Since the Chennai-based life insurance entity has net free assets of Rs  -  crore, Reliance Cap will pay a premium of Rs  -  crore. Net free assets essentially denote the book value of an insurance company, calculated after deducting losses from its share capital. AMP Sanmar has a capital base of Rs  .  crore. The non-banking finance arm of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Enterprise (ADAE) had initially decided to acquire AMP Sanmar through Reliance Life Insurance Company. But it was not possible as Reliance Life Insurance was not a legal entity since it did not have a licence from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA). IRDA Chairman CS Rao told Business Standard since Reliance Life Insurance was not a legal entity, it could not acquire AMP Sanmar. &#34;It is important for Reliance to identify the acquirer as the next step will be the due diligence exercise to be undertaken by the insurance regulator,&#34; he added. Declining to comment on the actual value of the deal, Graham Meyer, AMP Sanmar CEO, said it had not been a distress sale.   Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. BANKING/FINANCE AMP Sanmar Life is now Reliance Life Our Bureau   words   February   Business Line (The Hindu) BSNLNE   English (c)   The Hindu Business Line Hyderabad , Feb.   CONSEQUENT to the acquisition by Reliance Capital Ltdof the entire equity capital of AMP of Australia and Sanmar Group in AMP Sanmar Life Insurance Co Ltd , the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has taken note of the change of company name, `AMP Sanmar Life Insurance Co Ltd\&#39;, to that of Reliance Life Insurance Co Ltd (RLICL) and the fresh certificate of incorporation consequent to change of name issued by the Registrar of Companies, Tamil Nadu, dated January  . The insurance regulator said it had permitted RLICL to carry on life insurance business in India subject to the condition that RLICL should honour its commitments to the policyholders of AMP Sanmar Life Insurance on the same terms and conditions subject to which they were issued. Further, the regulator said in a notice here that RLICL should take necessary steps to protect the interests of the policyholders in accordance with the provisions of IRDA Act   and Insurance Act  .

Max Hypermarkets, part of Dubai\&#39;s Landmark Group, and French retailer Groupe Auchan have ended their two year old licence agreement in India. The failure to convert that agreement into a joint venture is the reason for ending the relationship, Max Hypermarkets said today. &#34;Max Hypermarkets and Groupe Auchan continued deep into   to look into the possibilities of creating a joint venture to facilitate Groupe Auchan investment in India, which could comply with Indian FDI regulations. Despite their best efforts, the parties could not facilitate this proposition,&#34; Max said in a statement. &#34;Therefore, by common agreement, the   Max Hypermarkets will no longer operate under the Auchan banner by January   at the latest,&#34; it said This is the second break-up for Max as it ended its ties with Dutch retailer Spar International in May  . After tying up with Auchan, Max rebranded its existing \&#39;SPAR\&#39; stores in Bangalore and Mangalore to \&#39;Auchan\&#39;. In September  , the UPA government allowed foreign direct investment in multi brand retail subject to approval of respective states. Barring UK-based Tesco, none of the foreign chains has applied for FDI in multi brand retail so far. Max Hypermarket is committed to growth and development of the hypermarket and supermarket business in India and will continue its investments under a new brand name, the Bangalore based company said.

Retail Walmart Stores spent $  mn to end its deal with Bharti Enterprises, resulting in a net loss of $  mn Rasul Bailay &amp; Sagar Malviya   words   April   The Economic Times ECTIM English (c)   The Times of India Group. All rights reserved. NEW DELHI | MUMBAI: Walmart Stores spent $  million (Rs ,  crore at current rates) to end its high-profile retail partnership with Bharti Enterprises, resulting in a net loss of $  million (Rs .  crore) accruing to the US company’s consolidated income in  . While the world’s largest retailer paid $  million (Rs  crore) to acquire Bharti’s stake in its India wholesale joint venture and go solo, it also took a $ -million (Rs ,  crore) hit that included debt and other investments in back-end partner Bharti Retail that it waived as part of the October   separation, according to its annual report issued last week. Walmart paid the $  million to acquire Bharti Enterprises’  % stake in the erstwhile Bharti Walmart Pvt Ltd that ran   Best Price-branded cash-andcarry stores. It was widely speculated that Walmart had compensated Bharti well to call off their six-year-old alliance but this is the first time the amount of money the US company paid to end its India equal JV has come to light. Bharti officials couldn’t be reached immediately for comment. Walmart India said it had nothing to add to the information already disclosed. ET reported previously that it cost Walmart around Rs ,  crore to purchase Bharti’s stake in the joint venture. After going well for the first four years since its inception in  , the Bharti-Walmart alliance turned rocky in the last two as the US firm focused attention on an internal probe to check if the unit had in any way violated US anti-bribery laws. Bharti, Walmart Trying to Expand Independently Scott Price, Walmart’s Asia head who has now been elevated to a global role, told ET in an interview earlier this month that the two partners had an &#34;amicable&#34; end to their six-year alliance. The two-year probe carried out by independent investigators, including US law firm Greenberg Traurig and consulting firm KPMG, prompted Bharti-Walmart to stall all expansion, suspend or sack top officials and ultimately drove a wedge between the partners. Walmart was intent on making sure that it hadn’t committed any violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which outlaws bribes to foreign government officials by US-listed entities to run or secure businesses. This followed a corruption scandal in Mexico, where company officials allegedly paid tens of millions of dollars in bribes to local officials to expand faster in the biggest foreign market for Walmart. After the Mexico episode, Walmart started investigating global operations including India and China. Walmart faced other difficulties in India as well. The Bentonville-based retail giant was hounded by Indian politicians for what was construed as lobbying to get India to open multi-brand retail to global supermarket chains. It also came under attack for its $ -million investment in Bharti Retail’s holding firm in   at a time India barred any sort of overseas investment in multi-brand retail. Politicians alleged that Walmart broke India’s foreign exchange laws through what they called illegal and indirect capital infinfusion into Bharti Retail, which ran a nationwide network of Easyday stores. Subsequently, India would change its rules to allow foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail but with strict conditions attached. Bharti will acquire the compulsory convertible debentures (CCDs) worth $  million that Walmart’s Mauritius-based investment arm had infused into Cedar Support Services, which owned Bharti Retail, as part of the separation agreement. In addition to the termination of the wholesale joint venture, Walmart also Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. snapped its &#34;franchisee and supply agreement with Bharti Retail Ltd which operates Bharti’s retail business in India and transferred its (Walmart’s) investment in that business to Bharti&#34;, the annual report said, apparently with reference to the $ -million CCD investment. Both Walmart and Bharti are trying to expand their businesses independent of each other. Walmart this month said it’s bullish on the India cash-and-carry business and plans to add   Best Price stores in the next five years. ET has reported that Walmart, which has formed a new company called Walmart India, has injected an additional Rs ,  crore into its operations in the country after its break-up with Bharti. A substantial chunk of this will go into developing the cash-and-carry stores and allied infrastructure, according to people aware of the plans.

Emerging Markets BP Walks Away From India\&#39;s Refining Renaissance   words   April   International Petroleum Finance IPF English (c)   Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved Harsh market conditions for downstream companies in India -- including hefty losses from sales of petroleum products below cost and a potential glut in domestic refining capacity -- are being blamed for last month\&#39;s decision by BP to pull out of a mooted refining and marketing joint venture with Hindustan Petroleum. BP had informed Hindustan that its board had found other projects more attractive at this time than the proposed Bhatinda refining venture, Hindustan Chief Executive MB Lal told a Mar.   press conference in New Delhi. Lal noted that India\&#39;s downstream conditions had worsened since BP signed a letter of intent last October with Hindustan to invest in a $  billion refinery in Bhatinda in northern India. The agreement also involved setting up a joint venture to market products from the proposed  ,  barrel per day inland refinery through a chain of cobranded retail outlets across India. &#34;They had ambitious plans,&#34; Lal told IPF. BP explained that its decision to abandon the joint venture with Hindustan was made because the project didn\&#39;t fit with its current plans. &#34;It\&#39;s a robust project, but it\&#39;s just not the right project for us at this moment in time,&#34; a BP spokeswoman told IPF. &#34;It doesn\&#39;t fit in with what we\&#39;re doing at the moment, so we\&#39;ve decided that we\&#39;re not going to take the letter of intent forward.&#34; India remains &#34;a place we would still look at,&#34; for both upstream and downstream, she added. Shortly after the letter of intent was signed, BP Chief Executive John Browne cautioned that this was no guarantee of any future alliance. &#34;We have a letter of intent, which is an agreement to agree,&#34; Browne had said. &#34;We do not have a deal.&#34; Lal told reporters that Hindustan would go ahead with the refinery, which will be designed to process  % sour crudes. &#34;We have a refinery on the east coast and one on the west,&#34; Lal said. &#34;The Bhatinda refinery is inland and complements the other two refineries.&#34; India\&#39;s northern region is short of products, and Bhatinda would help plug that gap, Lal said. Hindustan also plans to expand the east coast Vizag refinery, which processes  ,  b/d, by  ,  b/d at a cost of $ .  billion. &#34;By   we want to process  % sour crudes in all our refineries,&#34; said Lal. &#34;Our refineries will have an  % distillate content and make products suiting Euro-  and Euro-  standards.&#34; Lal said Hindustan\&#39;s coastal refineries could become largely export oriented, with Bhatinda catering to the domestic market, if Indian product demand remains largely flat at  .  million b/d. BP\&#39;s decision marks a blow to India\&#39;s attempt to attract foreign investments in the energy sector. The country deregulated its petroleum sector in April  , but oil companies were not allowed to raise pump prices in line with global price levels for the past year, leading to huge losses -- Hindustan incurred losses of around $  million for the nine months ending December   from selling petroleum products below cost. India\&#39;s petroleum sector, once touted as a high-growth market, is in the doldrums. The country\&#39;s existing  .  million b/d capacity, spread across   refineries, is already  % higher than current product demand, which has been negative in the current fiscal year to end-March. But this has not stopped the country from witnessing a boom in domestic refining investment, aimed at turning India into a global refining hub targeting export markets in Europe and the US. Hindustan\&#39;s Bathinda plant is one of eight refining projects that are set to add some  .  million b/d of new refining capacity to the Indian market by  , at a cost of around $  billion. The export drive has been led by private refiners such as Reliance Industries, which is adding a further  ,  b/d of processing capacity to its giant  ,  b/d Jamnagar plant between now and   (IPF Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. Oct.,p ). But Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) and Indian Oil Corp. (IOC) look set to jump on the export bandwagon, with both following the Jamnagar model by developing integrated refining and petrochemical complexes at Mangalore and Paradip, respectively.

All rights reserved. BANGALORE: Nusli Wadia-controlled Britannia Industries has agreed to buy out New Zealand\&#39;s Fonterra from an existing dairy joint venture, Britannia New Zealand Foods. Both Britannia and Fonterra, one of the world\&#39;s biggest milk co-operatives, agreed to call off the  :  JV, with the acquirer assuming the cumulative losses and the exiting foreign partner writing down the investments made into venture. The deal will bolster and unlock further synergies in Britannia\&#39;s go-to-market strategy. The company in recent months brought biscuits, cakes &amp; rusks and dairy products like cheese, butter, ghee and dairy whitener under one distribution vertical, while the \&#39;daily fresh\&#39; products, such as bread and dahi fall into another. The company\&#39;s distribution was fragmented till some time back, with all the business units approaching the trade separately. The mainstay biscuits, non-biscuit bakery (breads, cakes &amp; rusks) and dairy constitute three strategic business units within the Rs  ,  crore company. &#34;We have a single go-to-market strategy for Britannia as far as possible, which is helping us, especially with the modern trade. The distribution has been streamlined into two verticals, with the fresh consumption products like bread and curd forming one and remaining products going to the market under a separate vertical,&#34; Britannia Industries MD Vinita Bali told ET. In fact, Britannia has tweaked its brand strategy to accommodate the fresh consumption products under a newly-scripted Britannia Daily Fresh umbrella. Ms Bali said the dairy JV was reporting a turnover of Rs   crore and an annualized growth of  - %. The JV, which had turned profitable in recent years, has accumulated losses of around Rs   crore. &#34;We will be taking over the P/L of the JV and so the losses,&#34; she added. Fonterra, a significant supplier of milk ingredients to global food giants such as Danone and Nestle, wanted to exit the Indian market since it could not deliver much value addition, given the fragmented nature of India\&#39;s dairy industry. Fonterra is known for managing large dairy farms. It is not a big player in the branded dairy sector even though it has milk powder offering under Anchor brand in several south east Asian markets. Britannia will ramp up its presence in the dairy space through new product offerings post acquisition of the Fonterra stake. &#34;We will be looking at differentiated SKUs where we can innovate on the basic dairy technology. Take our cheese offering, for instance, where we have a market share of nearly  %. We came out with slim cheese (with  % lower fat) as well as cheese cubes and spreads that are clearly differentiated,&#34; Ms Bali said. The Britannia-Fonterra JV exited the liquid milk market in   in wake of mounting losses and has no plans of re-looking at the segment. &#34;It is a high volume low margin play that does not fit into our business model in dairy,&#34; she explained, suggesting that Britannia\&#39;s dairy play will essentially revolve around milk derivatives.

Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co., Ltd. Realtor to focus on selling premium, luxury fashion brands in the country Less than a fortnight after ending its joint venture with Giorgio Armani, DLF said it is in the process of breaking its partnership with another Italian luxury brand Salvatore Ferragamo as part of a move to exit luxury brands business.&#34;Luxury is a futuristic business in India at the moment and does not have scale,&#34; DLF Brands Chief Executive Officer Dipak Agarwal says. The real estate major will instead focus on selling premium and bridge-to-luxury fashion brands such as Boggi, Alcott, Mango, Mothercare, Claire\&#39;s and DKNY.&#34;This segment is much more profitable and scalable,&#34; Agarwal says. He says that while luxury brands have a big future in India, it will require another five to seven years to achieve scale and market size.&#34;For us, size with speed was important,&#34; he says. The company has had only four Ferragamo and three Armani stores since it entered the luxury brands segment in   as expansion of these brands in a limited market was getting difficult. In comparison, UK retailer Mothercare, which sells prams, pushchairs, car seats, baby clothes and also maternity clothes, entered India in   and already has   stores in the country. It will add   more stores this year. Boggi has   stores and DLF will add another three stores in the next one-year. The luxury market in India is bogged down with issues such as high import duties and lack of skilled manpower and quality real estate. There is only one luxury mall in the country currently, the DLF Emporio in Delhi, and brands are reluctant to enter high street locations due to poor infrastructure around them. The cost of retail real estate is very high and that has been nibbling into the profits of luxury retailers in the country. Today, it costs. -  crore to set up a luxury store while a store for a premium brand can be made for. -  lakh. To offset this cost, some luxury brands have resorted to reducing the size of their stores to improve the sales per sq ft of space. DLF Brands currently operates   stores for its brands and Agarwal hopes to take the number to   in the next three to four years. While the company has decided not to invest in new luxury brands at the moment, Agarwal says it may help some top brands enter the country through support on the real estate and supply chain fronts.

Real Estate Emaar to end JV with Indian partner MGF Swet Sarika   words   April   VC Circle MMVVCC English Copyright  . Mosaic Media Ventures Pvt. Ltd. Emaar Properties PJSC, Dubai’s biggest developer, has decided to end its  -year-old joint venture with MGF Developments Ltd in India following a year-long separation tussle between the partners. Emaar said in a statement on Wednesday it will take steps to reorganise Emaar MGF Land Ltd via a demerger to sharpen its focus on its Indian operations and develop ongoing projects. The development comes almost a year after reports first surfaced about a possible split due to disagreement between the partners but Emaar had denied any such move. The Dubai developer had brought in about Rs  ,  crore in the joint venture and owned roughly   per cent stake along with loans and guarantees while MGF held the remaining stake. While Emaar didn’t disclose details of the demerger, media reports have suggested that the Dubai firm is likely to get a bigger share when the two partners split assets. “They were in discussion to thrash out the various issues with regard to debt and partly completed projects that were stuck due to paucity of funds. It was a complicated process as it involves many running projects and large land parcels of about  ,  acres spread over various cities in India,&#34; The Economic Times reported citing a person familiar with the development. Emaar MGF, formed in  , is known mainly for building the Commonwealth Games Village for athletes taking part in the event’s   edition in New Delhi. However, it faced massive criticism for delays and poor construction quality. It also tried to float an initial public offering but couldn’t do so after the stock markets plunged following the global economic crisis in  . It made more attempts to launch an IPO in   and   but ultimately scrapped the plans. Emaar is famous for developing the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, in Dubai. Headed by chairman Mohamed Ali Rashad Alabbar, Emaar has operations in   countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Asia and Europe. MGF Development was started by Shravan Gupta in  . It claims to have delivered   million square feet of retail space and is developing about   million square feet of retail space and   million square feet of residential space. Known for its retail assets at the time of forming the JV, MGF now has presence across residential, commercial and retail segments with projects in Gurgaon, Mohali, Jaipur, Indore and Hyderabad.  The joint venture was formed during the heyday of real estate when huge capital flowed in. But exits have been a pain point with some markets under the grip of a slowdown. The past two years have been particularly painful for developers as tepid forced them to look for various financing options to survive.  The national capital region, where the company has maximum exposure, has been worst hit by the slowdown with sales slipping significantly over the years. This has taken the unsold stock with developers to an alarming level. Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.

Home Page HDFC buys Chubb out of JV Gayatri Ramanathan,feedback@livemint.com livemint   words   May   Mint HNMINT English Copyright  . HT Media Ltd. All Rights Reserved. Mortgage major Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) on Tuesday announced it has bought the  % stake of Chubb Global Financial Services Corp. in their joint venture, HDFC Chubb General Insurance Co., for an undisclosed amount. The general insurance joint venture was set up in  . An executive at HDFC, who did not wish to be named, said the book value of the equity in the joint venture was Rs  crore; that would mean the book value of Chubb’s stake is Rs  crore. Conrad D’Souza, treasurer at HDFC, said the company has applied to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irda), the watchdog for the sector, seeking its approval for the change in the holding pattern. People close to the development at HDFC, who did not wish to be identified, said Ergo, the insurance arm of the world’s second-largest reinsurance company—Germany’s €  billion (more than Rs  lakh crore) Munich Re—is the front-runner to pick up the Chubb stake. “Till such time the Ergo deal is finalized, HDFC will hold  % stake in the general insurance venture,” said one of these people. “Initial joint venture strategies did not get translated,” said D’Souza. HDFC Chubb lags behind other general insurers such as ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co., Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co., and others in terms of premiums collected. HDFC Chubb collected premiums of Rs  crore for the year ended March  , compared with Bajaj Allianz’s Rs ,  crore and ICICI Lombard’s Rs ,  crore. In fact, according to figures provided by Irda, while companies such as ICICI Lombard and Reliance General Insurance are growing at  - %, HDFC Chubb was actually not growing at all. The two companies differed on strategy, with HDFC favouring an aggressive customer acquisition strategy with a range of products and Chubb preferring a more conservative approach; “Chubb’s focus and HDFC’s focus were not the same,” said the executive at HDFC. Shrirang Samant, the insurance firm’s chief executive officer, quit two weeks ago. Indian insurance law caps an overseas partner’s stake in an insurance venture at  %, which restricts the amount of equity a foreign partner can put into a business that is highly capital-intensive. HDFC, which also has a life insurance joint venture with the UK’s Standard Life, wants a strategic partner with experience in general insurance, said the HDFC executive. “There are people interested in partnering with us,” said the executive. D’Souza said the proposed stake sale would be finalized only after the regulator’s approval. D’Souza also said insurance firms, both international and domestic, have expressed interest in picking up the Chubb stake. Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. “As of now, we will run the business as it is. Who comes in as a partner or who will be the CEO will be decided only after the regulator’s approval of the buyout,’’ D’Souza said. India has licensed   overseas and local non-life insurers as part of its plan to open the sector to expand coverage of insurance in the world’s second fastest growing major economy. The foreign investment cap of  % has been an irritant for most foreign firms, which claim that this restricts their ability to invest in the business. The industry has been lobbying to raise the limit on foreign investment to  %, but this has met with political opposition from some quarters. Several foreign insurance firms have informal arrangements with their Indian partners to increase their stake to  %, should this be allowed.

BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMY HDFC, Chubb to go their separate ways Nandini Goswami   words   May   DNA - Daily News &amp; Analysis DNADAI English Copyright  . Diligent Media Corporation Ltd. Local partner will buy out Canadian major\&#39;s  % stake in the JV It\&#39;s almost official. HDFC and Chubb, financial giants in their own right who had joined hands for a general insurance venture in the country, are parting ways. HDFC has agreed to buy out the  % stake held by the foreign partner in the joint venture HDFC Chubb General Insurance Company and has applied to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) for requisite approvals, an HDFC official told DNA Money on Tuesday. The company will continue as HDFC Chubb till a name change comes about, for which it has to apply to the Registrar of Companies. HDFC will now hold  % in the venture, though it is open to a  % foreign equity participation once it finds an appropriate foreign partner. The JV currently has an equity base of Rs   crore. &#34;All employees will continue to be a part of the same company, where HDFC will have the entire stake and we will chose someone to head the company once all this is through,&#34; the official said. Fissures in the over four-year relationship have grown since last year because of differing risk appetites of the partners. HDFC, given its size and distribution strength, was keen to move fast. However, Chubb had an overcautious approach, particularly on commercial insurance, which was proving to be a drag on the company, the official said. While all general insurance companies have grown their business, HDFC Chubb General reported a decline in business by  . % for  - . Its total business premium was Rs  .  crore, one of the lowest in the general insurance industry. Its counterparts and even later entrants have marched way ahead, even as the public sector companies with a large base have also grown at higher rates. Also, the dynamics of the Rs  ,  crore general insurance industry has changed since the detariff regime kicked off in January this year and there was a crying need for a cohesive management structure to fight it out in the fiercely competitive market place. A formal split was thus waiting to happen. On the kind of signals the split sends out, the official said, &#34;In fact, investors should be happy as there was a genuine concern for the company\&#39;s falling numbers and now there is a concerted effort to grow the company. Everyone has a different way of functioning, and given the fact that all our other companies, like life insurance, asset management, bank and the BPO, are doing so well, there should not be any misconception on the break-up, which has been mutually agreed upon,&#34; the official added. So, what happens to Chubb now? Sources indicated that the global insurance giant is unlikely to discontinue insurance business in India. More so, as insurance analysts say, it would be a costly proposition to leave India at this juncture, at a time when the economy is booming, and re-entering later may see it lose two to three years straightaway. Market grapevine has it that Chubb is also scouting around for partners. This time, though, it may find some comfort with a clutch of investors instead of one single company, possibly including some high net-worth Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. individuals as well. The model could be on the lines of Metlife India. Whether it will be called \&#39;Chubb India\&#39; or not, though, remains to be seen. This, however, could not be confirmed. Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. EIH terminates co-branding alliance with Hilton ; EIH Ltd, the flagship company of The Oberoi Group, today... BS REPORTER New Delhi   words   September   Business Standard BSTN English (c)   Business Standard Ltd. EIH Ltd, the flagship company of The Oberoi Group, today announced that it has terminated a strategic marketing and co-branding alliance with leading global hotel chain Hilton International Co. The decision will come into effect from April  ,  . Under the alliance, EIH managed and ran seven five-star hotels under the Trident Hilton brand Gurgaon, Agra, Cochin, Jaipur, Udaipur, Bhubaneshwar and Chennai. It also has a five-star deluxe property christened Hilton Towers in Mumbai. EIH will develop the Trident brand independently. All seven hotels will now be called The Trident and the deluxe property Trident Towers. &#34;We felt there was a possibility of a dilution in the Trident brand with Hilton\&#39;s overall development strategy in India. With Hilton planning to open the more downmarket Hilton Garden Inn in the country, we felt customers would get confused between that and the Trident Hilton,&#34; said SS Mukherji, vice-chairman, EIH. Realty firm DLF Ltd had forged a  :  joint venture with Hilton International last year. It is this joint venture company that will be setting up the Hilton Garden Inn brand. &#34;The first Trident opened way back in   and we entered into an alliance with Hilton only in  . So we have always had our own marketing set-up which only has to be revamped. The company is already marketing The Oberoi brand very successfully,&#34; said Mukherji. Over the next three years, EIH will add  ,  rooms across three Trident Hotels in Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. FRONT PAGE ICI India to sell entire stake in Quest Our Bureau   words   November   Business Line (The Hindu) BSNLNE English (c)   The Hindu Business Line Nov.   Paints and chemicals firm ICI India Ltd, a subsidiary of UK\&#39;s ICI Plc, has announced its plans to sell its entire stake in its wholly owned subsidiary Quest International India Ltd (Quest India) for not less than Rs   crore to Switzerland\&#39;s Givaudan Group. The company\&#39;s board of directors, at its meeting on Wednesday, approved the sale of its entire stake in Quest India — its flavours and fragrances business — to Givaudan Group, for a total consideration of not less than Rs   crore, ICI India informed the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). The announcement followed news that ICI Plc had agreed to sell Netherlands-based Quest International B.V. to Givaudan for $  .  billion (around Rs  ,  crore). ICI India said in a statement that &#34;ICI Plc has, after due evaluation, agreed to accept the offer for sale of Quest International business received by them very recently from the Givaudan Group, who has expressed interest in purchase of Quest India also. Considering the heavy linkages on the international business and the nature of the customers and the market, the board has decided to divest the company\&#39;s entire shareholding in its subsidiary Quest lndia to the said Givaudan Group.&#34; The Indian transaction is expected to be completed before the end of the financial year, subject to the global deal happening within the same timeframe, it said. ICI India has controlling interest in Quest India, which was established in   as a joint venture between the ICI Group and Hindustan Lever Ltd (HLL). As per the joint venture agreement, ICI India acquired HLL\&#39;s   per cent shareholding in May this year and subsequently acquired the remaining one per cent of the share capital held by a group company of ICI Plc. Consequently, Quest India became a wholly owned subsidiary of ICI India. Quest India reported net sales of Rs   crore and a net profit of Rs  .  crore for the financial year ended March  . The company is headquartered in Mumbai and has its manufacturing sites in Daman with about   employees on its rolls. Shares of ICI India were up seven per cent at Rs  .  on BSE on Wednesday. ICI has been carrying out a restructuring exercise wherein it will exit from non-core areas and focus on growing the core ones both organically and inorganically. As a step in this direction, ICI India, in June this year, announced the sale of the company\&#39;s Uniqema business to UK-based Croda Group for around Rs   crore. Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

India’s Kalyani Group has exited its steelmaking joint venture with Gerdau with the sale of its  % shareholding in the venture to the Brazilian steelmaking group, a Pune-based Kalyani Steel official confirmed to Platts Monday. The transaction was concluded in February, which was when Gerdau had announced the start of commercial production at the  ,  metric tons/year specialty steelworks at Tadipatri in southern India’s Andhra Pradesh state.

L&amp;T buys out Demag from joint venture ; After   years of joint operations, Larsen and Toubro (L&amp;T)... NEVIN JOHN Mumbai   words   June   Business Standard BSTN   English (c)   Business Standard Ltd. After   years of joint operations, Larsen and Toubro (L&amp;T) and Germany’s Demag Plastics Group have parted ways. The joint venture, which was set up in   for making plastics machinery, has ended after Demag’s new parent, Sumitomo, decided to go it alone in the Indian market by floating a wholly-owned subsidiary. “L&amp;T-Demag Plastics Machinery, the Chennai-based joint venture company, will no longer be in existence as L&amp;T has bought out its partner’s   per cent stake. Sumitomo, which acquired Demag in early- , has its own plan for India and it decided to break the relations with L&amp;T,” said a company executive. The purchase gives L&amp;T complete ownership of the operations in Chennai. After announcing its exit from the joint venture, Sumitomo Demag Plastics Machinery said in a statement, “As already announced in March  , Sumitomo Heavy Industries is proceeding to establish a subsidiary in India.” L&amp;T officials declined to comment on the development. In  , the joint venture company had built its first factory for injection moulding machines. Three years later, it built a second factory in Chennai that doubled its production capacity to a thousand machines a year. Sumitomo Heavy Industries inherited the   per cent stake in the operation when it bought Demag in March  . However, for more that   years, Sumitomo has had a technical collaboration with another Indian injection machinery maker, Windsor Machines in Mumbai. L&amp;T had started manufacturing injection moulding machines in   in association with Demag Plastics Group. But the two formed the  :  joint venture company only after nine years. Soon after, the venture had emerged as the leading injection moulding solutions provider in India. L&amp;T Demag launched a petition last year to the India government in which it accused Chinese rivals of dumping presses at below cost in the Indian market. The government responded earlier this year by imposing anti-dumping duties of up to   per cent on   Chinese companies. Among these, three are associated with China’s largest injection machine maker, Ningbo Haitian Plastic Machinery Group. Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.

Emerging Business &amp; IT Hetero Drugs buys out Lyka\&#39;s stake in JV   words   March   The Economic Times ECTIM English (c)   The Times of India Group. All rights reserved. HYDERABAD: Hyderabad-based Hetero Drugs, makers of the Tamiflu capsules, has bought out the stake of Gujarat-based Lyka Labs in the joint venture Lyka Hetero Healthcare for a consideration of Rs  .  crore. After gaining control of Lyka Hetero Healthcare, the company is busy drawing up a turnaround plan that includes fresh investments for improving sales margins and addition of new molecules in cardiology and antibiotics. Hetero expects the buyout of the JV partner\&#39;s stake in Lyka Hetero will give them the much-needed stability and foothold in the domestic market. With its expanded basket, including formulations in antibiotics, pain management and anti- asthmatic, Hetero is expecting to reduce its dependency on APIs considerably. &#34;Most of our turnover comes from export of APIs, where price volatility is high. By attaining full ownership of Lyka Hetero Healthcare, we will be able to focus on marketing formulations in domestic market. This will help us to circumvent the volatility, making our bottomline stronger,&#34; Hetero Drugs director (marketing), Srinivas Reddy, told ET. The company is likely to undertake a management restructuring as part of the turnaround. For the erstwhile joint venture, Hetero Drugs is looking to achieve a turnover of Rs   crore in one year against the present Rs   crore. &#34;We found it difficult to chalk out marketing strategies within the confinement of a JV. Now we can focus on achieving sales volumes for the existing products. It will take  -  months for the new molecules to attain critical mass,&#34; Mr Reddy said. However, the company refused to make any comments on management restructuring. &#34;The valuation process is on. It will take at least one month for us to finalise investments and other changes,&#34; he said. Lyka Hetero Healthcare was a  :  joint venture between Gujarat-based Lyka Labs and Hetero. It was floated to market Lyka\&#39;s products in the domestic market. Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.

(See: Dean McCumiskey to head BAE Systems in India (http://www.domain-b.com/people/in_the_news/ _bae_systems.html)) &#34;This decision is a reflection of the shareholders\&#39; belief that they can best meet emerging customer requirements and address the opportunities in this dynamic market with a flexible, tailored approach that was not easily facilitated by the structure of the existing joint-venture entity,&#34; both companies said in a joint statement. The two companies had set up the JV in   to develop new technologies and the manufacture of trusted armoured vehicles like the Axe, Rakshak, Marksman, up-armoured and bulletproof Scorpios and Boleros, and Rapid Intervention Vehicles. (See: Mahindra, BAE Systems set up defence JV for land systems (http://www.domain-b.com/companies/companies_m/Mahindra/ _mahindra_group_oneView.html)) At present, DLSI produces combat vehicles such as Rakshak, Rakshak Plus, Marksman and MPVi, armoured bus, riot intervention vehicle and Scorpio Uparmoured for VIP security. The company\&#39;s Prithla plant has a capacity to produce up to   vehicles a year, of which up to   are MPV-Is. In the last three to four years the company has invested about Rs  crore on the plant. Commenting on the development, Brigadier (Retd) Khutub Hai, chairman and MD of Mahindra Defence Systems, &#34;This is a strategic decision and will enable both the companies to approach opportunities individually and to offer customised solutions to meet the needs of the Indian defence land systems domain.&#34; Dean McCumiskey said, &#34;Building domestic capabilities in partnership with Indian companies will remain a cornerstone of our strategy in India. We look forward to opportunities to collaborate with Mahindra and others to enhance the role of the private sector in the defence industry.&#34; M&amp;M also has a JV with US-based Telephonics Corp to make radar systems and another with UAE-based Arabia Holdings and Ras Al Khaimah Transport Investments to develop armored vehicles for the Middle East, Central Asia and African market. BAE also has a software engineering joint venture in India called BAeHA with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. M&amp;M to acquire Navistar\&#39;s stake in MNAL Distributed by Contify.com   words   January   Commercial Vehicle ACOMVE English Copyright ©   Next Gen Publishing, distributed by Contify.com M&amp;M and partner Navistar International Corporation have entered into an MoU, wherein the former will buy out the latter\&#39;s equity in their JVs, Mahindra Navistar Automotives Ltd (MNAL) and Mahindra Navistar Engines Pvt Ltd (MNEPL). Following the purchase, both MNAL and MNEPL would become wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mahindra. Mahindra would take complete ownership of operations and continue to sell MNEPL and MNAL products albeit under its own brand name. The sale requires regulatory approval in India, is subject to the conclusion of definitive agreements, and is expected to be completed in early  . The terms of the proposed transaction call for Mahindra to pay approximately Rs.  crores or USD   million, for Navistar group\&#39;s stake in both ventures. The payout will happen in two parts. While,   percent will be paid out as and when the deal goes through (upon the receipt of regulatory approvals), the remainder will be payable five years from the date of the first payment. The agreement allows Navistar to continue sourcing components from India while Mahindra would continue to provide engineering services to Navistar. Navistar Group would continue to support M&amp;M through a license agreement and extend necessary support to MNAL and MNEPL for the purposes of business continuity. Crucially, the agreement covers the localised Maxxforce  .  litre engine. \&#39;Under the terms of our agreement, we can use the Maxxforce engine for as long as needed for business continuity. The engine may be deployed for the domestic market as well as export operations,\&#39; explains Dr. Goenka, President Automotive and Farm Equipment Sector. But, the engine is not exclusive to M&amp;M.; Navistar can still commercially exploit it, subject to, \&#39;a non-compete clause\&#39;. Further investments So far, MNAL has registered sales of just  ,  units in the last  -  years, significantly below expectation. This is because, any new player entering the Indian truck market has to contend with the strong incumbents. And the going has not been easy this year, thanks to the slowdown-induced spell of heavy discounting. Therefore, the JV has seen accumulated losses to the tune of Rs   crore, as against investments of Rs  ,  crore. But this scenario has not dampened M&amp;M\&#39;s commitment to the CV industry. \&#39;We stay committed to the truck and bus industry. Our dealers and trade partners are extremely happy with our intent to acquire Navistar\&#39;s stake. As a matter of fact, we shall be investing more into the truck and bus business,\&#39; asserts Dr. Goenka. M&amp;M reportedly intends to plough Rs  -  crore in a bid to turnaround MNAL\&#39;s operations over the next three years. The investment is meant to support and expand the range of almost completely localised trucks and engines as also its robust dealer and service network. M&amp;M is confident that it can succeed in the truck business on its own steam. \&#39;Given that we have a product range that is well-suited to the Indian market\&#39;s needs, we do not feel the immediate need for a foreign JV partner. But, to be honest, we have not yet applied serious thought to this aspect,\&#39; reveals Dr. Goenka. Navistar has decided to exit the JV because its finances are not in good shape. It has been the subject of investor activism and also the target of a speculated takeover by VW. What is more, a failed EPA   emissions compliance strategy saw longstanding Chairman Dan Ustian quit his position. Not surprisingly, the new management led by President and Chief Operating Officer, Troy Clarke is focussing on only those business areas that promise immediate return on capital under the \&#39;Drive to Deliver\&#39; programme. \&#39;While the Indian market has not expanded as we had originally expected and industry challenges there continue in the near term, we still see promise in India going forward. But given Navistar\&#39;s   priorities, our capital and focus needs to be allocated to other business opportunities in the near term.\&#39; Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. The end to the MNAL JV follows the recent dissolution of the MANFORCE JV. Industry observers believes that given the tough and competitive nature of India\&#39;s auto industry, it is often difficult to align the visions of Indian and foreign partners. Indeed, buyout of a partner\&#39;s stake is not an alien concept for M&amp;M.; It has acquired Renault\&#39;s stake in the erstwhile JV covering the localisation and sales of cars and utility vehicles under the Logan brand. In a possibly encouraging precedent for the truck business, the Logan, now badged Verito has been performing better than it did under Mahindra- Renault. Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

Kanwar\&#39;s Rs  ,  crore Apollo Tyres on Friday scrapped its much-touted two-year-old truck and bus radial tyre making joint venture with French tyre maker Michelin. Apollo has decided to walk out of the venture blaming the slow growth in the radial tyre market and deferment in project implementation. Apollo will now sell its  % stake in the the JV - christened Michelin Apollo Tyres Pvt Ltd (MATPL) - to its French partner at book value. Though company officials refused to divulge details of the financial transaction, sources said Apollo would get around $  million for its  % holding in the JV.

The board of directors of Apollo Tyres on Friday approved the transfer of the JV\&#39;s assets to Michelin. The proceeds from the stake sale will be used to expand Apollo\&#39;s existing facilities and grow its presence in tyre market. MATPL was floated nearly two years back and the partners had agreed to set up a plant in Ranjangaon (Pune) with an initial investment of $  million, the project is yet to get underway. &#34;The decision is based on prevailing market conditions and the pace of radialisation in the truck and bus tyre segments.

Mr Sarkar said that the slow pace of radialisation in the Indian truck and bus tyre segment (contributed by somewhat moderate progress in infrastructure build-up) had prompted Apollo Tyres to take a close look at its engagement with the joint venture company. &#34;We will get almost entire amount invested in the joint venture company.

How the two companies will move in the market for generics in Japan has been watched with great interest since Daiichi Sankyo acquired Ranbaxy in  .

As they reviewed their mutual strategy, however, they have reached a conclusion that the best for both companies is to independently develop their own business. “This is a friendly, forward-looking decision,”according to Nippon Chemiphar. “I don\&#39;t think Nippon Chemiphar will be able to fully develop its generics business on its own. We will consider partnering,”said President Kazushiro Yamaguchi of Nippon Chemiphar at a press conference in July   commenting on the possibility of M&amp;As and alliances for the development of his company\&#39;s generics business.

Ashok Leyland completes acquisition of LCV JVs with Nissan Anil Sharma   words   November   IHS Global Insight Daily Analysis WDAN English Copyright  , IHS Global Insight Limited. All Rights Reserved. Ashok Leyland has completed the acquisition of three joint ventures (JVs) with Nissan, the company said in a statement. The three JVs in question are Ashok Leyland Nissan Vehicles Ltd (ALNVL) for vehicle manufacturing; Nissan Ashok Leyland Power Train Ltd (NALPT) for making powertrains; and Nissan Ashok Leyland Technologies Ltd (NALT), a technology JV. All the three JVs operate in the light commercial vehicle (LCV) space. As part of the agreement reached between Ashok Leyland and Nissan, the latter transferred its shareholding in the three ventures to the former for a consolidated consideration of INR  (USD . ). Ashok Leyland will continue to build the Dost, Partner, and Mitr LCVs, while servicing and parts availability for customers will be taken care of by a Nissan technical support team.

The two companies signed the JVs in   in an effort to gain a foothold in India\&#39;s light and medium commercial vehicle market. However, the partnership did not go as planned with delays in product launches, declining sales, widening losses, and write-offs. Except for the Dost, the venture did not have any commercial success and the slower introduction of additional variants further contributed to the losses. Early this year, the differences between the partners came out into the public domain and subsequent development resulted in an exchange of legal notices to each other before both the parties decided to call off the partnership in September (see Japan – India:   September  : ).

BUSINESS Religare exits MF biz, sells  % to partner Invesco   words   November   Press Trust of India PRTRIN English Copyright  . The Press Trust of India Limited. New Delhi, Nov   (PTI) After life insurance, financial services group Religare Enterprises has decided to exit mutual fund business with sale of its controlling   per cent stake in Religare Invesco AMC to the foreign partner Invesco. While a number of foreign fund houses have exited the Indian mutual fund industry -- the latest being Goldman Sachs -- there have not been many cases where Indian entities have sold the asset management business. Earlier this year, Religare had sold its stake in its life insurance join venture. In May  , Religare had announced that it will exit Aegon Religare Life Insurance Company by selling its stake to existing partner Bennett, Coleman and Company Ltd (BCCL) of the Netherlands. Religare did not disclose the exact reasons for the sale of mutual fund business but sources said that the capital is being unlocked through mutual fund. The funds through stake sale will be used for health insurance and lending platform. The shares of Religare reacted negatively to the announcement and settled down at  .  per cent on the BSE in a strong broader market today. While the Indian mutual fund industry has been growing steadily, Religare Invesco has not seen any major upsurge in its asset under management in the recent past. Its average assets under management (AUM) stood at Rs  ,  crore for the quarter ended September, only marginally higher than Rs  ,  crore as on March   this year. In between, it had fallen to Rs  ,  crore in the quarter ended June. Without disclosing the deal size, Religare said in a statement that it has entered into a definitive agreement under which Invesco would increase its stake to   per cent in the joint venture. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals. Religare held   per cent in the JV while Invesco currently has   per cent ownership. Invesco\&#39;s Senior Managing Director and Head of Asia Pacific Andrew Lo said it would further deepen its presence in India by taking full ownership of this business. Religare Group CEO Shachindra Nath termed Invesco\&#39;s decision as &#34;an endorsement of the Indian macros&#34; and also of the overall quality of the management team. Saurabh Nanavati will continue as CEO, along with the existing senior management team of the fund house. Invesco had purchased   per cent stake in March  , wherein it was also given an option to further increase its stake before March  . In the recent past, a number of foreign fund houses have exited the Indian mutual fund market, but in most of those cases, the businesses were acquired by Indian entities. The latest deal, therefore, goes against the prevailing trend. PTI BJ SP MR Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. News Ruchi Soya, Kagome end India tomato joint venture.

Corporate Tata Metaliks Ends Water Pipes JV with Japanese Cos OUR BUREAU KOLKATA   words   March   The Economic Times - Mumbai Edition ECTMUM English Copyright ©  . Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co., Ltd. Move seen to be in line with plan to integrate the pipe-making facility with itself Tata Metaliks has ended its joint venture for manufacturing drinking water pipes with Japanese partners, Kubota and Metal One. The move is seen as a prelude to a larger plan towards integrating the pipe-making facility with TML. The joint venture, Tata MetaliksKubota Pipes (TMKPL) was incorporated in July   as a  % subsidiary of TML, with the Japanese partners Kubota and Metal One holding  % and  % stake, respectively.&#34;To start with, TML will acquire  % stake by buying out its Japanese partners in TMKPL. After which, the pipemaking business will be brought under TML\&#39;s fold. We continue to see a lot of prospect in the business,&#34; said Harsh Jha, managing director of Tata Metaliks, who is due to retire on Friday.&#34;We have separate agreements through which Tata Metaliks will continue to get technical and international marketing support from Kubota,&#34; he added. While there is an obvious tax advantage in the proposed move, TML\&#39;s board is also weighing other options for TMKPL that will attract tax benefits. This includes making TMKPL a conversion agent of TML. A clearer picture may emerge shortly, with the board due to take a call on it in the next three to four weeks.&#34;The company signed an agreement with Kubota and Metal One on March  , , terminating the joint venture agreement being executed from July  ,  in relation to Tata MetaliksKubota Pipes, subsidiary of the company,&#34; Tata Metaliks said to the BSE. SEVERE COMPETITION TMKPL, in which the partners had invested around.  crore, was affected by severe price competition in ductile iron (DI) pipes and was upstaged by intense price cutting by regional players in the last four to five years. Hit by low net realisations in an industry facing overcapacity, especially in the eastern region, TMKPL\&#39;s margins suffered.&#34;At one point, price of pig iron and DI pipes were at the same level. There was no premium on value addition which is absurd. The DI pipe market is essentially led by projects. There is no concept of marketshare. The situation worsened till it became economically unsustainable for a lot of companies that were operating at very low capacity,&#34; said an industry analyst. MINING CRISIS Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. Tata Metaliks\&#39; main business, too, has been affected due to irregular supplies of iron ore since the mining crisis broke out in Karnataka and Goa. In particular, it was forced to close down operations at its Redi plant at Sindhudurg, Maharashtra in October  . Earlier this week, it signed a memorandum of settlement with the Tata Metaliks Workers\&#39; Union at Redi in respect of all permanent employees in pursuance of its plans to close down operation there. Plans to sell off its Redi plant last year suffered after it failed to clinch a deal with the proposed buyer, Fomento. Snapping Ties JV WAS INCORPORATED IN   with Japanese partners Kubota and Metal One holding  % and  % stake, respectively WHILE THERE IS AN OBVIous tax advantage in the proposed move, TML\&#39;s board is also weighing other options for TMKPL that will attract tax benefits Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

The last of the links between Fiat in India and Tata Motors as far as sales and distribution goes has come to an end. While Fiat went independent with its sales and dealership network from May  , the distribution and outbound logistics piece was still being handled by Tata Motors. Fiat\&#39;s dependence on Tata Motor\&#39;s network will end in March. From April  , Fiat Group Automobiles India, Fiat\&#39;s sales and distribution arm, will be switching over to a new partner. Fiat has brought in their distribution and logistic partner from Italy to handle their logistics and distribution in India from their plant at Ranjangaon, near Pune. Mercurio Pallia Logistics will take over the distribution logistics of Fiat cars. Mercurio Pallia a joint venture company between Gruppo Mercurio of Italy and Pallia Transport of India. Gruppo Mercurio is owned by Gefco Logistics. Fiat works with Gefco in Italy and some European markets. Gefco is a subsidiary of Peugeot of France and is into vehicle transport and distribution business across the globe with a turnover of  .  billion euro. Robert DeCrick, head, supply chain management (APAC), Fiat Chrysler, said, &#34;They chose to go with an expert in the business rather than doing it themselves. This is not about fencing some agriculture land and starting to park on it. Unlike the car yards in India, the new Fiat stockyard was built on a solid surface with safety and security that ensure a better quality car was delivered to the customer. The yard also used IT extensively to offer better visibility for the dealership from invoice to delivery at the dealerships.&#34; On whether this investment in logistics would put an additional burden on the comapny\&#39;s costs, DeCrick said they did not view logistics as cost but as a key part of their business. The new logistics partner will be able to handle customer demands better and with the use of technology dealers will he happier as they will be able to track their supplies from invoice to the delivery of cars at their dealerships, DeCrick said. As of now Fiat has   dealerships and is adding six nee dealership in two weeks. The target is to reach   dealerships by December  . Fiat earlier had a network of   dealers through Tata Motors. Though the six year sales tie-up has ended, the manufacturing JV between Tata Motors and Fiat India remains intact. Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. BUSINESS RBI clears way for Tatas to buy back from DOCOMO Special Correspondent   words   January   The Hindu THINDU English (c)   Kasturi &amp; Sons Ltd MUMBAI,BUSINESS The Tatas are close to buying back NTT DOCOMO’s  .  per cent stake in Tata Teleservices Ltd (TTSL) at an earlier agreed upon price of Rs. ,  crore as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is understood to have relaxed its fair value pricing norm as a special case to enable them to honour their commitment made to the Japanese company. The easing of norms comes following enhanced business ties between India and Japan. The RBI’s fair value pricing norm does not allow companies to buy back shares at more price than the fair market value, and this is why the Tata- NTT DOCOMO deal could not be completed despite several notices from NTT DOCOMO and even the Japanese company initiating arbitration proceedings against Tata Sons and TTSL in London to recover its money. “Tata Sons has made the necessary application to the Reserve Bank of India. The company is awaiting a response,” a Tata Sons spokesperson said while responding to queries. In March,  , NTT DOCOMO had invested $ .  billion in TTSL to pick up  .  per cent stake. The shareholder’s agreement had guaranteed it at least   per cent of the investment if it wished to exit in case of TTSL failing to meet certain performance targets. Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co., Ltd. Tata Opportunity Fund to buy out the PE firm in the JV and form an infra entity that will, to start with, acquire three road projects of IVRCL Three years after private equity firm Actis and the Tata Group formed a $ -million JV - with an ambitious plan to spend ten times of that sum in building roads over five years - the venture is coming to an end. Actis is set to pull out of the JV and the Tatas have agreed to buy them out, said multiple sources aware of the ongoing transaction. Currently, Tata Realty &amp; Infrastructure (TRIL), a  % subsidiary of Tata Sons, owns  % of the venture called TRIL Roads while Actis owns the rest. TRIL was Tata Sons\&#39; initial vehicle for its foray into infrastructure and real estate development. The Tata-Actis disengagement is likely to conclude within a month.&#34;Actis will make a marginal return on its investments. Its focus has moved away from roads into power generation and distribution and it will continue to focus on these sectors through its infrastructure funds. This will be an amenable exit,&#34; said an official. Actis\&#39; exit is being facilitated by another Tata Group entity, Tata Opportunities Fund (TOF), the group\&#39;s captive PE fund which will buy them out. Actis PE\&#39;s India head JM Trivedi could not be reached for comments. Spokespersons from Tata Groups\&#39; external media agency Rediffusion did not respond to ET\&#39;s detailed questionnaire. London headquartered Actis - which was spun off from the Commonwealth Development Corporation nine years ago - had invested $ .  million (.  crore) for its minority stake, in what was then its first investment in the Indian infrastructure space. This money was deployed from its $ -million (. ,  crore) emerging markets focussed infrastructure fund. Close to  % of the fund\&#39;s proceeds were initially earmarked for India. Despite its initial ambitious plans, TRIL Roads and Actis has till date built only one project, the  -km Pune-Solapur highway with Italian company Atlantia SpA as its technical partner, for. ,  crore. But with TOF on board, TRIL Roads plans to pursue inorganic opportunities in the sector. TRIL-TOF TO BUY   IVRCL ROAD PROJECTS To start with, it is already in negotiations to buy the three road projects of cash-strapped infrastructutre company IVRCL - Salem Tollways, Kumarapalayam Tollways and Changapally-Wallayar Tollways. The three roads have been built on an estimated cost of. ,  crore. Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. In April this year, IVRCL entered into an agreement with TRIL Roads to transfer control in these three road projects, in an effort to monetise its build-operate-transfer assets. But in accordance with the terms of the concession agreement, TRIL Roads will separately buy  % in Salem and Kumarapalayam Tollways as they are already operational. IVRCL will continue with a  % exposure. However, for the Changapally-Wallayar Tollways, initially TRIL Roads will pick up only  % and upon completion of the project in the next five months, it will hike its stake to  %. After two years, IVRCL will exit entirely as the model concession agreement signed post   allows it to do so. Concessional agreement signed before   requires the original promoter to hold a minimum  %.&#34;We have all the necessary approvals from NHAI. We are just awaiting the lenders nod. We hope to conclude the deal in the next   days,&#34; said S Ramachandran, director, IVRCL Infrastructures &amp; Projects. Tatas will be shelling out around.  crore as equity for the IVRCL deal, while. ,  crore of debt and other liabilities will get transferred to them.&#34;One good thing about the three roads is that by FY , all three are expected to achieve breakeven. But these are just four-lane state highways with moderate traffic growth projections,&#34; said Abhinav Bhandari, infrastructure analyst at Elara Capital.arijit.barman@timesgroup.com Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

Elizabeth Rigby and Nayantara Rai in London   words   November   Financial Times (FT.Com) FTCOM English (c)   The Financial Times Limited. All rights reserved Tesco of the UK admitted on Friday that its plan to be the first multinational supermarket retailer in India has unravelled. The world\&#39;s fifth-biggest supermarket chain said it had ended talks with Bharti Enterprises to set up a joint venture in India\&#39;s GBP bn-a-year ($ bn) retail sector after discussions failed. It now looks like Wal-Mart, the biggest global retailer, could lead the advance into the world\&#39;s eighth-largest retail market. Sunil Mittal, the telecommunications tycoon who controls Bharti, refused to be drawn on his negotiations with Tesco. &#34;We will make an announcement shortly on a global partner for our retail foray,&#34; he told the Financial Times. Tesco, Carrefour and Wal-Mart have been linked to Bharti, but it appears that only the US chain is still in the race. It is thought that the Tesco-Bharti deal fell apart in the final stages of the talks after the two parties failed to find common ground on the pace of expansion, with Bharti opting for a more aggressive opening programme than Tesco envisaged. Tesco is also thought to have felt frustrated by leaks about the talks. Under Indian rules, no foreign direct investment is allowed in the retail sector, except for single-brand stores, which means big groups have to sign a franchise or licensing agreement with local companies. India is on track to become the fifth-biggest retail market by  , according to McKinsey. Organised retailing makes up   per cent of the market, giving big chains scope to expand. Confirming that it had walked away from discussions with Bharti, Tesco said: &#34;We remain excited by the opportunities available in India.&#34; Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.

Under the agreement, Bharti will acquire the   per cent each held by Global Holding Corporation Private Ltd (part of the GTL group) and Tulip Telecom Ltd, to whom it is paying around Rs   crore each. The premium the two investors will earn from the deal comes to an annualised return of around   per cent on their investment. The balance equity has been bought by way of subscription of fresh equity in the entity. The deal also contemplates that once commercial operations are launched, subject to certain terms and conditions being met, Bharti would also pick up the remaining   per cent stake by May  . Qualcomm had forked out Rs  ,  crore to win the BWA licence and paid the money through a combination of debt and equity. That included about Rs  ,  crore in equity and the rest through debt. The interest on the debt for the last two years that the company forked out while waiting for spectrum comes to around Rs  ,  crore. Based on this, the enterprise value of the company stands around Rs  ,  crore. Barclays was mandated by Qualcomm to structure the deal. The US company received its spectrum just a few weeks ago after a bitter battle with the DoT (Department of Telecommunications) and after it moved the TDSAT following a delay of nearly two years. The DoT gave it the spectrum but with the licence period reduced from   years to  . . The roll-out obligation time was also reduced from five years to three and a half. Commenting on the deal, Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman and managing director, Bharti Airtel, said, “This partnership will combine the strength of Bharti’s national telecom footprint and Qualcomm’s technological leadership in the LTE TDD space. With a broadband-ready network across India, Bharti is well positioned to lead the next phase of Indian’s telecom revolution.” Apart from  G, Bharti has  G services in   circles. Bharti added in its press release that with the deal, “it secured nationwide broadband leadership through a combination of  G and  G, with its own networks in   circles”. “One of our key objectives has been to include a strong partner in the Indian venture with the scale, experience and resources to deploy LTE TDD networks. We are pleased to have Bharti’s participation and support in this effort,” said Paul E Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Qualcomm. Tulip Telecom chairman H S Bedi confirmed his company had been paid Rs   crore for the   per cent stake. “Yes, we have been paid Rs   crore, which is at a premium to what we had spent.” Asked how the Rs   crore that Qualcomm has paid to the DoT on Tulip Telecom’s behalf for disputed dues, as directed by the TDSAT, Bedi said, “We had an agreement with Qualcomm that only after we had exhausted all options and not found a remedy would we pay the money back. However, I am confident this is an erroneous demand by the DoT.” Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. According to top sources, Bharti has also been talking to Aircel for an alliance in the BWA space, which could include using its network to get into seven more circles. According to sources, the circles that have been identified include Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, the north-east, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. Depending on the final policy and judgments on whether inter-circle roaming would be deemed legal, the move could help Bharti become a pan-India  G player, with presence in   circles. That would bring it head to head with the only other pan-India player, Reliance Infotel, which is preparing for a major launch by the end of this year. Bharti, however, said it would not like to comment on speculation. Aircel did not comment. Qualcomm had made it public it would not like to get into the services business and would divest stake to partners. Its main interest in bidding for BWA spectrum was to ensure operators used it to launch services on LTE, a technology it has been backing over Wimax. The US company’s main interest is to make money by selling chipsets for  G devices. The company is working on chipsets that will support devices to seamlessly move between  G,  G and  G without the customer realising the change. Qualcomm expects to provide technical assistance to Bharti in connection with network architecture and optimisation, infrastructure and device testing. Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

Essar exits Vodafone-Essar JV for USD   billion   words   March    :  Organisation of Asia-Pacific News Agencies OANA English © Copyright  . OANA. All rights reserved. New Delhi (PTI) Putting an end to the corporate battle, UK-based Vodafone Thursday announced it would exercise the option to acquire its Indian partner Essar\&#39;s   per cent stake which will result in payment of USD five billion. With this, Vodafone may have to look for another domestic partner to remain compliant with the FDI norms in the telecom sector of a maximum stake of   per cent. &#34;Vodafone Group announces that the Essar Group has exercised its underwritten put option over   per cent of Vodafone Essar Limited (VEL). &#34;Following the exercise by the Essar Group of its put option, Vodafone has exercised its call option over the remaining   per cent of VEL owned by the Essar Group, resulting in a total cash payment of USD   billion,&#34; Vodafone said in a statement. Call Option allows an investor the right but not the obligation to buy a stock, bond, commodity or other instrument at a specified price within a specific time period. On the other hand, Put Option is an option contract giving the owner the right but not the obligation to sell a specified amount of an underlying security at a specified price within a specified time. With this, Essar will exit completely from the joint venture, which is offering nationwide mobile services in India. Vodafone has over   million subscribers and is the third largest operator in India. Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. Vodafone also said that final settlement is anticipated to be completed by November,  . Sources in the know said that the completion of deal would be subject to meeting certain conditions which include Reserve Bank of India\&#39;s permission as well as valuation of the deal. The final shareholding pattern post this deal was not provided by the company as it was not clear whether Vodafone\&#39;s stake would exceed the   per cent FDI limit. Vodafone had entered Indian market in   when it bought Hutchison\&#39;s stake in the joint venture for over USD   billion and after that it had entered into an agreement with Essar for a call and put option for its stake. The two firms were locked in battle over Essar\&#39;s plan to list a firm that had part stake in the joint venture to find out market value of its   per cent stake. The move was opposed by Vodafone saying this may not give true value of Vodafone\&#39;s stake. It had approached the market regulator SEBI and also filed a petition in the Madras High Court.

independent investigators  including US law firm Greenberg Traurig and consulting firm KPMG  prompted Bharti-Walmart to stall all expansion  suspend or sack top officials and ultimately drove a wedge between the partners  Walmart was intent on making sure that it hadn’t committed any violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  which outlaws bribes to foreign government officials by US-listed entities to run or secure businesses  This followed a corruption scandal in Mexico  where company officials allegedly paid tens of millions of dollars in bribes to local officials to expand

Emerging Markets BP Walks Away From India\&#39;s Refining Renaissance   words   April   International Petroleum Finance IPF English (c)   Energy Intelligence Group  All rights reserved Harsh market conditions for downstream companies in India -- including hefty losses from sales of petroleum products below cost and a potential glut in domestic refining capacity -- are being blamed for last month\&#39;s decision by BP to pull out of a mooted refining and marketing joint venture with Hindustan Petroleum  BP had informed Hindustan that its board had found other projects more attractive at this time than the proposed Bhatinda refining venture  Hindustan Chief Executive MB Lal told a Mar    press conference in New Delhi  Lal noted that India\&#39;s downstream conditions had worsened since BP signed a letter of intent last October with Hindustan to invest in a    billion refinery in Bhatinda in northern India  The agreement also involved setting up a joint venture to market products from the proposed     barrel per day inland refinery through a chain of cobranded retail outlets across India  &#34;They had ambitious plans &#34; Lal told IPF  BP explained that its decision to abandon the joint venture with Hindustan was made because the project didn\&#39;t fit with its current plans  &#34;It\&#39;s a robust project  but it\&#39;s just not the right project for us at this moment in time &#34; a BP spokeswoman told IPF  &#34;It doesn\&#39;t fit in with what we\&#39;re doing at the moment  so we\&#39;ve decided that we\&#39;re not going to take the letter of intent forward &#34; India remains &#34;a place we would still look at &#34; for both upstream and downstream  she added  Shortly after the letter of intent was signed  BP Chief Executive John Browne cautioned that this was no guarantee of any future alliance  &#34;We have a letter of intent  which is an agreement to agree &#34; Browne had said  &#34;We do not have a deal &#34; Lal told reporters that Hindustan would go ahead with the refinery  which will be designed to process    sour crudes  &#34;We have a refinery on the east coast and one on the west &#34; Lal said  &#34;The Bhatinda refinery is inland and complements the other two refineries &#34; India\&#39;s northern region is short of products  and Bhatinda would help plug that gap  Lal said  Hindustan also plans to expand the east coast Vizag refinery  which processes     b d  by     b d at a cost of      billion  &#34;By   we want to process    sour crudes in all our refineries &#34; said Lal  &#34;Our refineries will

guarantees while MGF held the remaining stake  While Emaar didn’t disclose details of the demerger  media reports have suggested that the Dubai firm is likely to get a bigger share when the two partners split assets  “They were in discussion to thrash out the various issues with regard to debt and partly completed projects that were stuck due to paucity of funds  It was a complicated process

joined hands for a general insurance venture in the country  are parting ways  HDFC has agreed to buy out the    stake held by the foreign partner in the joint venture HDFC Chubb General Insurance Company and has applied to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) for requisite approvals  an HDFC official told DNA Money on Tuesday  The company will continue as HDFC Chubb till a name change comes about  for which it has to apply to the Registrar of Companies  HDFC will now hold    in the venture  though it is open to a    foreign equity participation once it finds an appropriate foreign partner  The JV currently has an equity base of Rs   crore  &#34;All employees will continue to be a part of the same company  where HDFC will have the entire stake and we will chose someone to head the company once all this is through &#34; the official said  Fissures in the over four-year relationship have grown since last year because of differing risk appetites of the partners  HDFC  given its size and distribution strength  was keen to move fast  However  Chubb had an overcautious approach  particularly on commercial insurance  which was proving to be a drag on the company  the official said  While all general insurance companies have grown their business  HDFC Chubb General reported a decline in business by      for  -   Its total business premium was Rs     crore  one of the lowest in the general insurance industry  Its counterparts and even later entrants have marched way ahead  even as the public sector companies with a large base have also grown at higher rates  Also  the dynamics of the Rs     crore general insurance industry has changed since the detariff regime kicked off in January this year and there was a crying need for a cohesive management structure to fight it out in the fiercely competitive market place  A formal split was thus waiting to happen  On the kind of signals the split sends out  the official said  &#34;In fact  investors should be happy as there was a genuine concern for the company\&#39;s falling numbers and now there is a concerted effort to grow the company  Everyone has a different way of functioning  and given the fact that all our other companies  like life insurance  asset management  bank and the BPO  are doing so well  there should not be any misconception on the break-up  which has been mutually agreed upon &#34; the official added  So  what happens to Chubb now  Sources indicated that the global insurance giant is unlikely to discontinue insurance business in India  More so  as insurance analysts say  it would be a costly proposition to leave India at this juncture  at a time when the economy is booming  and re-entering later may see it lose two to three years straightaway

buy out the latter\&#39;s equity in their JVs  Mahindra Navistar Automotives Ltd (MNAL) and Mahindra Navistar Engines Pvt Ltd (MNEPL)  Following the purchase  both MNAL and MNEPL would become wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mahindra  Mahindra would take complete ownership of operations and continue to sell MNEPL and MNAL products albeit under its own brand name  The sale requires regulatory approval in India  is subject to the conclusion of definitive agreements  and is expected to be completed in early    The terms of the proposed transaction call for Mahindra to pay approximately Rs   crores or USD   million  for Navistar group\&#39;s stake in both ventures  The payout will happen in two parts  While    percent will be paid out as and when the deal goes through (upon the receipt of regulatory approvals)  the remainder will be payable five years from the date of the first payment  The agreement allows Navistar to continue sourcing components from India while Mahindra would continue to provide engineering services to Navistar  Navistar Group would continue to support M&amp;M through a license agreement and extend necessary support to MNAL and MNEPL for the purposes of

years  significantly below expectation  This is because  any new player entering the Indian truck market has to contend with the strong incumbents  And the going has not been easy this year  thanks to the slowdown-induced spell of heavy discounting  Therefore  the JV has seen accumulated losses to the tune of Rs   crore  as against investments of Rs     crore  But this scenario has not dampened M&amp;M\&#39;s commitment to the CV industry  \&#39;We stay committed to the truck and bus industry  Our dealers and trade partners are extremely happy with our intent to acquire Navistar\&#39;s stake  As a matter of fact  we shall be investing more into the truck and bus business \&#39; asserts Dr  Goenka  M&amp;M reportedly intends to plough Rs  -  crore in a bid to turnaround MNAL\&#39;s operations over the next three years  The investment is meant to support and expand the range of almost completely localised trucks and engines as also its robust dealer and service network  M&amp;M is confident that it can succeed in the truck business on its own steam  \&#39;Given that we have a product range that is well-suited to the Indian market\&#39;s needs  we do not feel the immediate need for a foreign JV partner  But  to be honest  we have not yet applied serious thought to this aspect \&#39; reveals Dr  Goenka  Navistar has decided to exit the JV because its finances are not in good shape  It has been the subject of investor activism and also the target of a speculated takeover by VW  What is more  a failed EPA   emissions compliance strategy saw longstanding Chairman Dan Ustian quit his position  Not surprisingly  the new management led by President and Chief Operating Officer  Troy Clarke is focussing on only those business areas that promise immediate return on capital under the \&#39;Drive to Deliver\&#39; programme  \&#39;While the Indian market has not expanded as we had originally expected and industry challenges there continue in the near term  we still

the fair market value  and this is why the Tata- NTT DOCOMO deal could not be completed despite several notices from NTT DOCOMO and even the Japanese company initiating arbitration proceedings against Tata Sons and TTSL in London to recover its money  “Tata Sons has made the necessary application to the Reserve Bank of India  The company is awaiting a response ” a Tata Sons spokesperson said while
